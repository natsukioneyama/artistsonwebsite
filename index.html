    <!-- INTRO -->

  <section id="intro"> <h2>Introduction</h2> 
    <p> I am a freelance makeup artist. After trying services like Wix, Format, and Cargo, as well as the typical “web production company” model, I could never find a system that truly fit the needs of an individual artist’s portfolio. </p>
    <p> Especially for hair and makeup artists, most web services are simply too much—too expensive, too complex, or too dependent on external designers and production companies. </p> 
    <p> After testing multiple platforms and still feeling unsatisfied, I eventually decided to learn how to code and build my own site from scratch. I started at the perfect moment: just as AI tools were rapidly evolving. This made it possible—even for someone like me, with only beginner-level programming skills—to create a clean, stable, agency-quality portfolio website. </p> 
    <p> In terms of cost transparency, usability, and long-term stability, I now feel that this approach offers more control and clarity than many professional web designers can provide. </p> 
    <p> Thanks to a combination of hand-written code, modern tools, and AI, I can now offer a system that is simple, transparent, and easy to maintain—not only for myself, but also for the artists around me. For independent creatives working every day in a competitive city like Paris, this has become one of the most practical and efficient options available for maintaining a strong, reliable portfolio. </p>

   </section>

  <section id="about-service">
  <h2>About This Service</h2>

  <p>
    This is not a commercial web design business.  
    It is a small, invitation-only support service for a limited number of friends I personally trust.  
    The most important feature is that it is <strong>strictly limited to a maximum of 10 artists</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    I do not mass-produce websites.  
    Keeping the group small allows me to maintain quality, care, and proper communication.  
    Even though the structure is “semi-custom,” the final result is very close to a fully custom, artist-specific website—something that does not look like anyone else’s template.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am not a web agency.  
    I simply help reduce unnecessary costs and dependencies while providing a clean, stable, agency-level portfolio that expresses you accurately as an artist.
  </p>

  <p>
    My own portfolio <a href="https://natsukioneyama.com" target="_blank">natsukioneyama.com</a> is built entirely by hand, using custom code and GitHub.  
    The system I offer here is the same one I use for my professional work, and it has proven reliable in real-world conditions.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="limit">
  <h2>Limited & Friends-Only Service</h2>

  <p>This service is not publicly offered.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>It is only available to makeup/hair artists I personally know.</li>
    <li>People I trust and want to stay connected with long-term.</li>
    <li>Artists who genuinely need a professional portfolio website.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    By limiting this project to a maximum of 10 people,  
    I can maintain quality, communication, and a pace that feels safe for both of us.
  </p>

<section id="github">
  <h2>About GitHub – How It Works & Who Owns the Site</h2>

  <p>
    GitHub is a Microsoft-owned platform and one of the largest code-hosting
    services in the world. It is where millions of developers and designers
    store, share, and publish their projects. In terms of reliability,
    speed, and stability, it is one of the strongest free hosting environments
    available today.
  </p>

  <h3>What is “hosting”?</h3>
  <p>
    Hosting simply means placing your site files (HTML / CSS / JavaScript, etc.)
    on an online server so anyone can access your website.  
    Many people imagine paid servers or monthly contracts,  
    but GitHub Pages provides hosting <strong>completely for free</strong>.  
    Creating an account is also free.
  </p>

  <h3>Why many professional designers use GitHub today</h3>
  <p>
    In recent years, more and more professional web designers have started  
    building client websites on GitHub Pages.  
    The reason is simple — it meets all the essential conditions:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Fast</li>
    <li>Stable</li>
    <li>Secure</li>
    <li>No running costs</li>
    <li>Hard to break</li>
    <li>No dependency (the owner is always you)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>How this differs from design studios and standard freelancers</h3>
  <p>
    Even if a designer uses GitHub, most studios or freelancers will still charge  
    “maintenance fees” or “management fees” every month or every year.
  </p>

  <p>
    But in my system, the site is built directly inside  
    <strong>your own GitHub account</strong>, and the code is  
    <strong>100% owned by you</strong>.  
    As long as your GitHub account exists, the site remains your asset forever.
  </p>

  <h3>Why this method is ideal for artist portfolios</h3>
  <p>
    Portfolio sites do not need heavy features or large servers.  
    In reality, the best portfolio is one that is:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Lightweight</li>
    <li>Stable and hard to break</li>
    <li>Fast</li>
    <li>Easy to maintain</li>
    <li>Independent of any designer or company</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Using this structure allows me to create  
    a long-lasting, agency-level portfolio site with  
    minimal cost and maximum control for the artist.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="concept">
  <h2>Core Concept</h2>

  <p>
    The portfolio sites I create are built on a simple, highly visual structure.  
    In the hair & makeup profession, everything depends on “how the work is shown.”
    That’s why the design removes unnecessary decoration and focuses on clarity —
    allowing your world, technique, and aesthetic to be communicated simply
    through scrolling.
  </p>

  <p>
    Many of my artist friends are individualistic and ambitious.
    They are not satisfied with staying where they are — they continue to push
    their personal expression, whether through client work, personal projects,
    or day-to-day creative exploration.
    Even if you already have a client-facing portfolio or agency book,  
    there are very few places where you can present  
    the images you *want* to show, exactly the way you want to show them,
    including personal and experimental work that forms your true foundation.
  </p>

  <p>
    I believe this is the true purpose of a personal artist portfolio.  
    A place where your world can be shown as it is — without compromise,
    without unnecessary restrictions, and in a format that supports your pace
    and your long-term direction.
  </p>

  <p>
    What I offer is a practical, cost-efficient way to express your work  
    exactly as you envision it:  
    clean, simple, visually strong, and structured for real creative careers.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="pricing">
  <h2>Pricing – Production Assistance Fee (1200€)</h2>

  <p>This service is a small-scale production assistance program limited to <strong>10 artists only</strong>.</p>

  <p><strong>Production Assistance Fee: 1200€ (includes creation + the first 2 years of support)</strong></p>

  <p>
    The 1200€ fee includes the initial creation of your portfolio website and 2 years of operational support. 
    When converted monthly, the cost is approximately <strong>50€ / month</strong>. 
    It is designed to be a long-lasting, low-maintenance portfolio solution suitable for professional artists working on real projects.
  </p>

  <p>Additionally,</p>
  <p>・ Using GitHub Pages means there are no server hosting costs</p>
  <p>・ Your only running cost is the annual fee for your own custom domain</p>
  <p>・ After the first 2 years, optional support renewal is available (100€ / 2 years)</p>


     <div class="summary-outer">
    <div class="summary-inner">
    <p class="summary-label">In short,</p>
    <p class="summary-main">
      → With just 1200€ + your domain fee, you can run your own custom website long-term.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>
</section>



<section id="market-facts">
  <h2>Market Facts – What Website Production Usually Costs</h2>

  <p>
    At first glance, 1200€ may seem high.  
    But when you look at the actual market rates for portfolio websites,
    this price is actually on the lower end.
  </p>

  <h3>Approximate breakdown when hiring a professional web designer</h3>
  <p>
    For a simple hair & makeup portfolio site — for example, an overview page plus a lightbox gallery —
    the typical cost from a freelance designer in Europe looks something like this:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Consultation & structure planning:</strong> 200–400€  
      (site map, deciding what goes where)
    </li>
    <li><strong>Design (top page + overview + basic info page):</strong> 400–700€</li>
    <li><strong>Coding (HTML / CSS / JavaScript, responsive layout):</strong> 400–800€</li>
    <li><strong>Overview gallery + lightbox implementation:</strong> 300–500€</li>
    <li><strong>Server setup, domain connection, final checks:</strong> 150–300€</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Altogether, this usually comes to around  
    <strong>1500–2700€</strong>, depending on the project and designer.
  </p>

  <h3>Monthly “maintenance fees”</h3>
  <p>
    Many designers and production companies also charge monthly or annual fees for:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Server & domain management</li>
    <li>Security updates or backups</li>
    <li>Small text or image updates</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These maintenance plans typically cost  
    <strong>30–100€ per month</strong>, sometimes more depending on the provider.
  </p>

  <p>
    In reality, website creation and maintenance add up quickly — especially for artists,  
    whose portfolio is part of their professional identity and daily work.
  </p>

  <p>
    That is why the one-time creation fee of 1200€ (including two years of support)  
    is designed to be a realistic and predictable option.  
    Everything essential is included upfront, with no hidden running costs.
  </p>

<section id="compare">
  <h2>Other Options – Website Builder Services</h2>

  <h3>About Wix / Format / Cargo and similar platforms</h3>
  <p>
    These tools are “website builders” where you choose a template and assemble your site visually.
    They are convenient and quick, but for long-term portfolio use, especially for image-driven artists,
    there are several limitations.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Design freedom is limited by the template’s structure</li>
    <li>Difficult to fully customize image layout or presentation style</li>
    <li>Ongoing subscription fees (usually 200–300€ per year)</li>
    <li>Your layout may change when the service updates their templates</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    For professions where “how the work is presented” is crucial — such as hair & makeup —
    these template limitations can directly affect the impression your work makes.
  </p>

  <h3>How my GitHub-based approach differs</h3>
  <p>
    The system I provide is built around one priority:  
    <strong>your work should look its absolute best.</strong><br>
    Using lightweight code and GitHub Pages (free), the site is designed to be fast, stable,
    and completely independent.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>No running costs</strong> (no hosting fee, no maintenance contracts)</li>
    <li><strong>You are the owner</strong> — the code and repository belong to your GitHub account</li>
    <li><strong>Fast and lightweight</strong> — ideal for photo-heavy portfolios</li>
    <li><strong>No unnecessary features</strong> — only what is needed to showcase your work</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    For artist portfolios, a lightweight static site is often the strongest and least stressful choice,
    both creatively and financially.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="aftercare">
  <h2>Aftercare – The First Two Years</h2>

  <p>
    During the first two years, you can request up to two small updates per week  
    (image additions, replacements, caption or text edits). These are included at no extra cost.
  </p>

  <p>
    Larger structural changes — such as adding new categories or redesigning layouts —
    will be treated as new tasks and discussed separately.
  </p>

  <p>
    Any issues present at the moment of delivery (display glitches, broken links, layout errors)
    are fully my responsibility and will be fixed free of charge.
  </p>

  <p>
    However, issues caused by <strong>external factors</strong> after delivery — such as updates to iOS,
    browser changes, new device screen sizes, or unexpected changes in GitHub’s behavior —  
    fall outside the creator’s responsibility.
  </p>

  <p>
    When these external changes cause display issues, I will still check the situation and,
    whenever possible, help fix the problem.  
    Depending on the amount of work required, this may lead to an additional fee, discussed case by case.
  </p>

  <p>
    This service is intended only for friends I trust and want to support for the long term.  
    I aim to help as much as possible while keeping a structure that is fair for both sides.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="renewal">
  <h2>Support Renewal – Optional</h2>

  <p>
    After the initial two years, your site will remain online exactly as it is.  
    If you would like me to continue handling small updates and maintenance,
    you can choose the optional renewal plan:
  </p>

  <p><strong>Support Renewal: €100 / 2 years</strong></p>

  <p>
    Should there come a time when I can no longer offer support,
    I will notify you at least six months before the end of your current support period.
  </p>
</section>
<section id="payment-flow">
  <h2>Production & Payment Flow</h2>

  <p>
    This project follows a clear and simple process.  
    From the first conversation to the final launch, the workflow goes as follows:
  </p>

  <h3>1. Direction Meeting</h3>
  <p>
    We start by discussing the overall direction of your portfolio site—your current position,
    the images you want to highlight, the categories you need, and the visual tone of the site.
    Together, we decide on the most suitable structure and layout.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Sending Images & Text</h3>
  <p>
    After the direction is set, you send me your photos, captions, credits, and any relevant text.
    If your material is already organized, we can use it as is; if not, we will arrange it together.
  </p>

  <h3>3. Development Starts</h3>
  <p>
    Once all materials are ready, I begin coding and designing the layout:
    the overview gallery, lightbox display, category structure, and any required text pages.
    This is where your custom portfolio site takes shape.
  </p>

  <h3>4. Test Link (Preview)</h3>
  <p>
    When the build is complete, I publish a temporary preview using GitHub Pages.
    You can check the site on your phone, tablet, and computer to confirm layout, image flow,
    and text accuracy.
  </p>

  <h3>5. Final Review & Approval</h3>
  <p>
    If you have any adjustments, I will update them.  
    Once the final version is ready, you confirm your approval.  
    This marks the completion of the production stage and leads to the payment step.
  </p>

  <h3>6. Payment</h3>
  <p>
    After reviewing the test link on your own devices and confirming that everything is correct,
    you provide your approval and proceed with the production support fee (€1200).
  </p>

  <h3>7. Domain Connection & Official Launch</h3>
  <p>
    After the payment is confirmed, I connect your site to your chosen domain  
    and officially publish it as your portfolio website.
  </p>

  <p>
    If any small issues appear a few days after launch—such as minor visual adjustments or image alignment—
    I will fix these <strong>free of charge</strong>.  
    This is normal for static sites across different devices.
  </p>
</section>
<section id="return-policy">
  <h2>Return Policy (Cancellations & Refunds)</h2>

  <p>
    This service is a “results-based” support project offered only to trusted friends.  
    You confirm the completed website through a test link first, and only then proceed with the payment.
  </p>

  <h3>Cancellations</h3>
  <p>
    You may cancel at any stage if the project becomes difficult to continue  
    or if the direction changes.  
    In that case, please inform me as early as possible so we can align on the current progress.
  </p>

  <h3>Refunds After Approval</h3>
  <p>
    Once you have reviewed the test link and given your “approval,”  
    the production is considered complete.  
    Refunds after approval cannot be issued,  
    <strong>unless there is a critical, non-fixable coding error caused by me.</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    Minor issues that may appear a few days after launch  
    (such as small layout adjustments or image alignment)  
    will be corrected <strong>free of charge</strong>,  
    as these are common with static sites across different devices.
  </p>

  <h3>External Factors</h3>
  <p>
    Changes caused by external factors — such as iOS updates, browser updates,  
    GitHub behavior changes, or device-specific differences —  
    <strong>are not eligible for refunds</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    When such external issues occur, I will check and help where possible,  
    but the work may involve additional fees depending on the amount of adjustment required.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="faq">
  <h2>FAQ</h2>

  <h3>Is this fully custom?</h3>
  <p>This is essentially a semi-custom website. However, the final result is very close to the quality of a fully custom build.</p>

  <h3>What is the difference between full custom and semi custom?</h3>
  <p>
    Typical semi-custom sites rely on existing templates or CMS platforms (Wix, WordPress, etc.) where only colors or basic layout settings are adjusted.
    My approach does not use templates. Layout, image structure, spacing, and presentation are all designed from scratch — making it closer to “full custom.”
  </p>

  <h3>Why not make it fully custom?</h3>
  <p>
    Artist portfolios do not require complex CMS systems or plugins — in fact, these often make sites heavier and more fragile.
    By building only what is necessary from scratch, the result is a lightweight, stable, long-term portfolio that is less prone to breakage.
  </p>

  <h3>Why is it called a “production assistance fee” instead of a “production fee”?</h3>
<p>
  This service is designed to reduce unnecessary dependency between you and me in the long-term operation of your site.  
  Therefore, all code files and the GitHub account are <strong>fully owned by you</strong> from the beginning.
</p>
<p>
  You are responsible for the artistic direction of your website,  
  while I provide the proposals and technical support needed to realize that vision.
</p>
<p>
  In other words, the website is not something “I make for you,” but  
  <strong>a collaborative creation between you and me</strong>.  
  For that reason, the cost is defined as a “production assistance fee,” not a standard production fee.
</p>


  <h3>Who owns the website?</h3>
  <p>You do. Both the GitHub account and the code are under your name.</p>

  <h3>Is the 2-year renewal mandatory? And when is it?</h3>
  <p>
    No, renewal is optional. Even without renewal, your website remains online.  
    I will notify you one month before your support period ends.
  </p>

  <h3>What is included in the free updates?</h3>
  <p>Up to two small updates per week (image additions, replacements, caption fixes, etc.).</p>

  <h3>Is it possible that Natsuki stops offering this service in the future?</h3>
  <p>
    Yes, it is possible.  
    My main profession is makeup artistry, and there may be a time when I become too busy to continue.  
    If I decide to discontinue the service, I will notify you at least <strong>6 months in advance</strong>.
  </p>

  <h3>Then, is there any chance you will stop the service immediately after delivering my site?</h3>
  <p>
    No, there is no such risk.  
    I will <strong>always fulfill the first 2 years of support</strong> after delivery.  
    This is a core part of the service, and unless I face a major unforeseen circumstance (accident, serious illness, etc.), I will not abandon it.  
    You can use the initial 2-year support with full confidence.
  </p>

  <p>
    Your website lives in your own GitHub account and is entirely your property.  
    You may continue using it as is, or transfer it to another designer if needed.
  </p>

  <h3>Can another designer take over or modify the code?</h3>
  <p>
    Yes. The website belongs to you, so you are free to work with any designer you choose.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, code rewritten by someone else may differ from my structure.  
    In case of issues, <strong>the same support conditions may not apply</strong>, so please consult me first.
  </p>
  <p>
    If an error is caused by third-party modifications, assistance will be handled separately (additional cost), depending on the situation.
  </p>

  <h3>What if I’ve never used GitHub?</h3>
  <p>
    No problem.  
    We will go through the necessary steps together when creating your account.  
    I will handle all the complex parts and publishing setup.  
    You do not need to touch any code.
  </p>

  <h3>How do I send new photos or updates?</h3>
  <p>
    Just send your images, captions, and credits via DM or email.  
    This is included in the “2 updates per week” support.
  </p>

  <h3>How many images can I upload?</h3>
  <p>
    There is no technical limit.  
    However, too many images can dilute the artistic direction. We will decide the ideal balance together.
  </p>

  <h3>What if I want to change the structure after the site is finished?</h3>
  <p>
    Small adjustments are possible.  
    Larger structural changes (new categories, major layout redesigns) will be discussed as new work.
  </p>

  <h3>Can you create a second semi-custom site for me?</h3>
  <p>
    It may be possible depending on my schedule.  
    Please contact me first.
  </p>

  <h3>Are the usage rights for my photos okay?</h3>
  <p>
    I assume the client has permission to use the photos.  
    Responsibility for copyright lies with the client (you), not the designer.
  </p>

  <h3>Is the site optimized for SEO?</h3>
  <p>
    Advanced SEO is not necessary for artist portfolios, but  
    the essential metadata and structure are properly set up.  
    This website is not meant to “rank widely,” but to  
    <strong>reach the specific people you want to show your work to.</strong>
  </p>
  <h3>Q. Is there a possibility that the service content or structure may change in the future?</h3> 
  <p> A. Yes. To maintain and improve the quality of support, the service contents, policies, and applicable fees may be reviewed and adjusted. In such cases, any changes will be explained in advance to clients who are currently using the service, and will only be applied after receiving their understanding and approval. </p>

  <h2>Final Message</h2>

  <p>
    Thank you so much for reading through everything.  
    What started simply as a personal need — building my own portfolio —  
    eventually made me realize that many artists around me were struggling  
    with the exact same problems.
  </p>

  <p>
    I wanted to create something small, personal, and meaningful:  
    a way to support trusted friends, and to help each of us move forward  
    in our creative careers with clarity and confidence.
  </p>

  <p>
    That intention is what shaped this project —  
    the small, friend-based support system I call  
    <strong>“Artists on Website.”</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    This is not about business expansion or building a large client list.  
    It’s simply a clear and transparent structure that I share  
    with the artists I genuinely care about.
  </p>

  <p>
    If this project becomes even a small push forward in your creative journey,  
    it would mean the world to me.

  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>
    Je suis maquilleur freelance. Après avoir essayé des services comme Wix, Format 
    ou Cargo, ainsi que des modèles traditionnels de « création de site web », 
    je n’ai jamais trouvé de solution réellement adaptée aux besoins d’un portfolio artistique individuel.
  </p>

  <p>
    Pour les maquilleurs et coiffeurs, la plupart des services web sont tout simplement 
    trop chargés : trop coûteux, trop complexes ou trop dépendants de prestataires externes.
  </p>

  <p>
    Après avoir testé plusieurs plateformes sans jamais être pleinement satisfait, 
    j’ai finalement décidé d’apprendre à coder et de créer mon propre site depuis zéro.  
    Et le timing était parfait : l’évolution rapide des outils d’IA a rendu possible, 
    même pour un débutant en programmation comme moi, 
    la création d’un site portfolio propre, stable et digne d’une agence.
  </p>

  <p>
    En termes de transparence des coûts, de facilité d’utilisation et de stabilité à long terme, 
    cette approche offre désormais plus de contrôle et de clarté que celle de nombreux designers professionnels.
  </p>

  <p>
    Grâce à une combinaison de code écrit à la main, d’outils modernes et d’IA, 
    je peux aujourd’hui proposer un système simple, transparent et facile à maintenir – 
    non seulement pour moi, mais aussi pour les artistes qui m’entourent.  
    Pour les créatifs indépendants travaillant chaque jour dans une ville compétitive comme Paris, 
    cela représente l’une des options les plus efficaces et réalistes pour maintenir un portfolio fiable.

<section id="about-service-fr">
  <h2>À propos de ce service</h2>

  <p>
    Il ne s’agit pas d’une activité commerciale de création de sites web.  
    C’est un service d’accompagnement à petite échelle, accessible uniquement 
    à un nombre limité d’ami·e·s en qui j’ai une confiance personnelle.  
    L’élément le plus important est qu’il est <strong>strictement limité à 10 artistes maximum</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Je ne produis pas de sites en série.  
    Maintenir un nombre restreint de projets me permet de préserver la qualité,  
    l’attention et une communication fluide.  
    Même si la structure est dite « semi-personnalisée »,  
    le résultat final se rapproche très fortement d’un site entièrement sur mesure —  
    un site unique, qui ne ressemble à aucun modèle utilisé par d’autres.
  </p>

  <p>
    Je ne suis pas une agence web.  
    Mon objectif est simplement de réduire les coûts inutiles et les dépendances,  
    tout en fournissant un portfolio propre, stable et au niveau d’une agence,  
    fidèle à votre identité artistique.
  </p>

  <p>
    Mon propre portfolio  
    <a href="https://natsukioneyama.com" target="_blank">natsukioneyama.com</a> 
    a été réalisé entièrement à la main, avec du code personnalisé et GitHub.  
    Le système que je propose ici est exactement celui que j’utilise 
    pour mon travail professionnel, et il a déjà fait ses preuves sur le terrain.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="limit-fr">
  <h2>Service limité et réservé aux ami·e·s</h2>

  <p>
    Ce service n’est pas proposé au public.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Il est uniquement destiné aux maquilleur·se·s / coiffeur·se·s que je connais personnellement.</li>
    <li>Des personnes en qui j’ai confiance et avec qui je souhaite garder un lien à long terme.</li>
    <li>Des artistes qui ont réellement besoin d’un portfolio professionnel.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    En limitant ce projet à un maximum de 10 personnes,  
    je peux garantir la qualité, une bonne communication  
    et un rythme de travail confortable pour nous deux.

<section id="github-fr">
  <h2>À propos de GitHub – Fonctionnement et propriété du site</h2>

  <p>
    GitHub est une plateforme appartenant à Microsoft et l’un des plus grands services
    d’hébergement de code au monde. Des millions de développeur·se·s et designers y
    stockent, partagent et publient leurs projets. En termes de fiabilité, de vitesse
    et de stabilité, c’est aujourd’hui l’un des environnements gratuits les plus solides.
  </p>

  <h3>Qu’est-ce que l’« hébergement » ?</h3>
  <p>
    Héberger un site signifie simplement placer les fichiers (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.)
    sur un serveur en ligne pour que n’importe qui puisse y accéder.  
    Beaucoup de personnes imaginent qu’il faut payer un serveur ou un abonnement,
    mais GitHub Pages propose un hébergement <strong>entièrement gratuit</strong>.  
    La création de compte est également gratuite.
  </p>

  <h3>Pourquoi de nombreux designers professionnels utilisent GitHub aujourd’hui ?</h3>
  <p>
    Depuis quelques années, de plus en plus de web designers construisent
    les sites de leurs client·e·s sur GitHub Pages.  
    La raison est simple : GitHub remplit toutes les conditions essentielles.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Rapide</li>
    <li>Stable</li>
    <li>Sécurisé</li>
    <li>Aucun coût d’hébergement</li>
    <li>Difficile à « casser »</li>
    <li>Pas de dépendance (le/la propriétaire, c’est toujours vous)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Ce qui distingue cette méthode des studios ou freelances classiques</h3>
  <p>
    Même lorsqu’un designer utilise GitHub, la plupart des studios ou freelances
    facturent tout de même des « frais de maintenance » ou de « gestion »
    chaque mois ou chaque année.
  </p>

  <p>
    Dans mon système, le site est construit directement dans  
    <strong>votre propre compte GitHub</strong>, et le code vous appartient  
    <strong>à 100 %</strong>.  
    Tant que votre compte GitHub existe, votre site reste votre propriété.
  </p>

  <h3>Pourquoi cette méthode est idéale pour un portfolio artistique</h3>
  <p>
    Les portfolios n’ont pas besoin de fonctionnalités lourdes ou de grands serveurs.
    En réalité, un bon portfolio doit être :
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Léger</li>
    <li>Stable et difficile à casser</li>
    <li>Rapide</li>
    <li>Facile à maintenir</li>
    <li>Indépendant de tout designer ou entreprise</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Cette structure permet de créer un site durable, sobre, professionnel,
    avec un coût minimal et un contrôle maximal pour l’artiste.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="concept-fr">
  <h2>Concept Fondamental</h2>

  <p>
    Les sites que je crée reposent sur une structure simple et très visuelle.
    Dans les métiers du maquillage et de la coiffure, tout dépend de la manière
    dont les images sont présentées. C’est pourquoi le design élimine toute
    décoration inutile et met l’accent sur la lisibilité — votre univers,
    votre technique et votre sens esthétique doivent se transmettre
    naturellement, simplement en faisant défiler les images.
  </p>

  <p>
    Beaucoup de mes ami·e·s artistes sont ambitieux·ses et profondément
    individualistes. Ils ne se contentent jamais de rester à leur niveau actuel :
    ils poussent constamment leur expression personnelle, que ce soit à travers
    leur travail commercial, leurs projets personnels ou leur recherche créative
    au quotidien.
  </p>

  <p>
    Même si vous possédez déjà un book pour vos clients ou une sélection gérée
    par une agence, il existe très peu d’endroits où vous pouvez présenter
    exactement <em>les images que vous voulez montrer</em>, de la manière que vous
    souhaitez : y compris les projets personnels, expérimentaux ou les visuels
    qui forment réellement la base de votre identité artistique.
  </p>

  <p>
    Pour moi, c’est précisément le rôle d’un portfolio personnel : un espace où
    votre univers peut être montré sans compromis, sans restrictions inutiles,
    dans un format qui respecte votre rythme et votre direction artistique.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ce que je propose, c’est une manière pratique et réaliste de présenter votre
    travail exactement comme vous l’imaginez : propre, simple, visuellement fort,
    et construit pour accompagner une carrière créative sur le long terme.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="pricing-fr">
  <h2>Tarif – Frais d’assistance à la création (1200€)</h2>

  <p>Ce service est un programme d’assistance à la création, limité à <strong>10 artistes maximum</strong>.</p>

  <p><strong>Frais d’assistance : 1200€ (inclut la création + 2 premières années de support)</strong></p>

  <p>
    Les 1200€ couvrent la création initiale de votre site portfolio ainsi que 2 ans de support technique. 
    Cela revient à environ <strong>50€ / mois</strong>. 
    Le site est conçu pour être durable, stable et peu coûteux à maintenir — idéal pour un·e artiste qui travaille sur des projets professionnels.
  </p>

  <p>De plus,</p>
  <p>・ GitHub Pages est gratuit : aucun frais d’hébergement serveur</p>
  <p>・ Le seul coût récurrent est le prix annuel de votre nom de domaine</p>
  <p>・ Après 2 ans, renouvellement du support possible selon vos besoins (100€ / 2 ans)</p>


   <div class="summary-outer">
  <div class="summary-inner">
    <p class="summary-label">En résumé,</p>
    <p class="summary-main">
      → Avec seulement 1200€ + le coût du domaine, vous pouvez faire fonctionner votre propre site personnalisé à long terme.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

</section>


<section id="market-facts-fr">
  <h2>Informations sur le marché – Le coût réel d’un site web</h2>

  <p>
    À première vue, 1200€ peut sembler élevé.  
    Mais lorsqu’on observe les tarifs réels du marché pour des sites portfolio professionnels,  
    ce montant est en réalité plutôt raisonnable — voire inférieur à la moyenne.
  </p>

  <h3>Exemple de tarification chez un webdesigner freelance</h3>
  <p>
    Pour un site portfolio simple destiné à un·e maquilleur·se / coiffeur·se  
    — par exemple une page “overview” + une galerie en lightbox —  
    voici les fourchettes de prix généralement observées en Europe :
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Consultation & structure du site :</strong> 200–400€  
      (création du plan du site, organisation du contenu)
    </li>
    <li><strong>Design (page d’accueil, overview, page info) :</strong> 400–700€</li>
    <li><strong>Coding (HTML / CSS / JavaScript, responsive) :</strong> 400–800€</li>
    <li><strong>Galerie overview + système lightbox :</strong> 300–500€</li>
    <li><strong>Configuration serveur, domaine, vérifications finales :</strong> 150–300€</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Au total, la plupart des projets se situent entre  
    <strong>1500€ et 2700€</strong>, selon le designer et la complexité.
  </p>

  <h3>Les “frais de maintenance” mensuels</h3>
  <p>
    Beaucoup de studios ou freelances facturent également des frais mensuels ou annuels pour :
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Gestion du serveur et du domaine</li>
    <li>Mises à jour de sécurité et sauvegardes</li>
    <li>Petites modifications d’images ou de textes</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Ces plans de maintenance coûtent généralement  
    <strong>30–100€ par mois</strong>, parfois davantage selon le prestataire.
  </p>

  <p>
    En réalité, créer et maintenir un site peut vite devenir coûteux —  
    surtout pour les artistes dont le portfolio est un outil de travail essentiel.
  </p>

  <p>
    C’est pour cette raison que les <strong>1200€</strong> — incluant deux ans de support —  
    sont pensés comme une solution réaliste, simple et prévisible.  
    Tout ce qui est vraiment nécessaire est compris dès le départ,  
    sans frais récurrents cachés.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="compare-fr">
  <h2>Autres options – Services de création de sites web</h2>

  <h3>À propos de Wix / Format / Cargo et autres plateformes similaires</h3>
  <p>
    Ces outils sont des « website builders » : vous choisissez un template et vous
    assemblez votre site visuellement.  
    Ils sont pratiques et rapides, mais pour un usage professionnel à long terme,
    surtout dans les métiers visuels, ils présentent plusieurs limites.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>La liberté de design est limitée par la structure du template</li>
    <li>Difficile d’obtenir une présentation d’images réellement personnalisée</li>
    <li>Abonnements récurrents (souvent 200–300€ par an)</li>
    <li>Les templates peuvent changer lors des mises à jour du service</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Pour les métiers où « la manière de montrer les images » est cruciale —  
    comme le maquillage ou la coiffure éditoriale — ces limites peuvent affecter
    l’impact visuel de votre travail.
  </p>

  <h3>En quoi ma méthode (basée sur GitHub) est-elle différente ?</h3>
  <p>
    Le système que je propose repose sur une priorité :  
    <strong>votre travail doit être présenté de la manière la plus belle et la plus claire possible.</strong>  
    Grâce à un code léger et à GitHub Pages (gratuit), le site est rapide, stable
    et totalement indépendant.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Aucun coût de fonctionnement</strong> (pas d’hébergement ni de maintenance payante)</li>
    <li><strong>Vous êtes le/la propriétaire</strong> — le code et le repository sont dans votre compte GitHub</li>
    <li><strong>Rapide et léger</strong> — idéal pour les portfolios basés sur l’image</li>
    <li><strong>Aucune fonctionnalité superflue</strong> — uniquement ce qui est nécessaire pour montrer votre travail</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Pour un portfolio d’artiste, un site statique léger est souvent  
    la solution la plus solide, la plus simple et la moins stressante —  
    autant artistiquement que financièrement.
  </p>
</section>
<section id="aftercare-fr">
  <h2>Suivi après livraison – Les deux premières années</h2>

  <p>
    Pendant les deux premières années, vous pouvez demander jusqu’à deux petites mises à jour par semaine  
    (ajout ou remplacement d’images, corrections de texte, mise à jour de crédits, etc.).  
    Ces interventions sont incluses sans frais supplémentaires.
  </p>

  <p>
    Les modifications plus importantes — comme l’ajout de nouvelles catégories,
    la restructuration du site ou la refonte d’une mise en page —  
    seront considérées comme de nouveaux travaux et feront l’objet d’une discussion séparée.
  </p>

  <p>
    Tous les problèmes présents au moment de la livraison (affichages incorrects, liens cassés,
    erreurs de mise en page) sont entièrement de ma responsabilité  
    et seront corrigés gratuitement.
  </p>

  <p>
    En revanche, les problèmes causés par des <strong>facteurs externes</strong> après la livraison  
    — mises à jour d’iOS, changements de navigateurs, nouveaux formats d’écran,  
    comportements modifiés de GitHub, ou erreurs provoquées par des manipulations externes —  
    ne relèvent pas de la responsabilité du créateur.
  </p>

  <p>
    Si ces facteurs externes causent des problèmes d’affichage,  
    j’examinerai la situation et interviendrai autant que possible.  
    Selon la quantité de travail nécessaire, une tarification supplémentaire  
    pourra être discutée au cas par cas.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ce service est destiné uniquement à des amis en qui j’ai confiance  
    et que je souhaite accompagner sur le long terme.  
    Mon objectif est d’aider autant que possible, tout en maintenant  
    un cadre équilibré et réaliste pour les deux parties.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="renewal-fr">
  <h2>Renouvellement du support – Optionnel</h2>

  <p>
    Après les deux premières années, votre site restera en ligne tel quel,  
    même si vous ne renouvelez pas le support.  
    Si vous souhaitez que je continue à gérer les petites mises à jour et le suivi,  
    vous pouvez choisir l’option de renouvellement :
  </p>

  <p><strong>Renouvellement du support : 100€ / 2 ans</strong></p>

  <p>
    Si un jour je ne suis plus en mesure d’assurer le support,  
    je vous en informerai au moins six mois avant la fin de votre période de support en cours.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="payment-flow-fr">
  <h2>Processus de création et de paiement</h2>

  <p>
    Ce projet suit un processus simple et clair.  
    De la première discussion jusqu’à la mise en ligne finale, voici les étapes :
  </p>

  <h3>1. Discussion sur la direction</h3>
  <p>
    Nous définissons ensemble l’orientation de votre site portfolio :  
    votre position actuelle, les images que vous souhaitez mettre en avant,  
    les catégories nécessaires et l’esthétique générale.  
    Cela permet de déterminer la structure et la mise en page idéales.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Envoi des images et textes</h3>
  <p>
    Une fois la direction validée, vous m’envoyez vos photos, légendes, crédits  
    et tout texte pertinent.  
    Si votre matériel est déjà organisé, nous l’utilisons tel quel ; sinon,  
    nous le structurons ensemble.
  </p>

  <h3>3. Début du développement</h3>
  <p>
    Dès que tout le matériel est prêt, je commence le codage et la mise en page :  
    galerie overview, lightbox, structure des catégories, pages texte nécessaires.  
    C’est à cette étape que votre site portfolio prend forme.
  </p>

  <h3>4. Lien de prévisualisation (test)</h3>
  <p>
    Une fois la construction terminée, je publie une version temporaire  
    via GitHub Pages.  
    Vous pouvez vérifier l’affichage sur téléphone, tablette et ordinateur,  
    et confirmer l’ordre des images, les légendes et la cohérence générale.
  </p>

  <h3>5. Révision finale et approbation</h3>
  <p>
    S’il y a des modifications à apporter, je les intègre.  
    Une fois la version finale validée, vous donnez votre approbation.  
    Cette étape marque la fin de la production et ouvre la phase de paiement.
  </p>

  <h3>6. Paiement</h3>
  <p>
    Après avoir vérifié le lien de test sur vos appareils et confirmé que tout est correct,  
    vous donnez votre approbation et procédez au paiement des 1200€  
    de frais de création.
  </p>

  <h3>7. Connexion du domaine et mise en ligne officielle</h3>
  <p>
    Une fois le paiement confirmé, je connecte le site à votre nom de domaine choisi  
    et procède à la mise en ligne officielle en tant que votre site portfolio.
  </p>

  <p>
    Si de petits ajustements apparaissent dans les jours suivant la mise en ligne  
    — comme des micro-ajustements visuels ou d’alignement —  
    je les corrigerai <strong>gratuitement</strong>.  
    Ce sont des ajustements normaux pour les sites statiques selon les appareils.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="return-policy-fr">
  <h2>Politique de retour (Annulations & Remboursements)</h2>

  <p>
    Ce service est un accompagnement basé sur le résultat, proposé uniquement à des amis de confiance.  
    Vous validez d’abord la version finale du site via un lien de test,  
    et ce n’est qu’après votre approbation que le paiement est effectué.
  </p>

  <h3>Annulations</h3>
  <p>
    Vous pouvez annuler à n’importe quelle étape si le projet devient difficile à poursuivre  
    ou si la direction change.  
    Dans ce cas, merci de me prévenir dès que possible afin que nous puissions  
    faire le point sur l’avancement.
  </p>

  <h3>Remboursements après validation</h3>
  <p>
    Une fois que vous avez validé le lien de test et donné votre “approbation”,  
    la production est considérée comme terminée.  
    Aucun remboursement ne pourra être effectué après cette validation,  
    <strong>sauf dans le cas très rare d’une erreur critique et irréparable  
    provenant directement de mon code.</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    Les petits ajustements pouvant apparaître dans les jours suivant la mise en ligne  
    (ajustements visuels mineurs, alignement des images, etc.)  
    seront corrigés <strong>gratuitement</strong>,  
    car il s’agit de situations normales liées aux différences entre appareils.
  </p>

  <h3>Facteurs externes</h3>
  <p>
    Les problèmes causés par des facteurs externes — comme les mises à jour iOS,  
    les mises à jour des navigateurs, les changements de comportement de GitHub,  
    ou les différences entre modèles d’appareils —  
    <strong>ne sont pas éligibles à un remboursement</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Lorsque ces changements externes provoquent des anomalies d’affichage,  
    je vérifierai la situation et vous aiderai dans la mesure du possible.  
    Selon la quantité de travail nécessaire, une tarification supplémentaire  
    pourra être proposée au cas par cas.

<section id="faq-fr">
  <h2>FAQ</h2>

  <h3>Est-ce un site entièrement sur mesure ?</h3>
  <p>La base est un site semi-personnalisé, mais le résultat final est proche de la qualité d’un site entièrement sur mesure.</p>

  <h3>Quelle est la différence entre “full custom” et “semi custom” ?</h3>
  <p>
    Le semi-custom classique utilise des modèles existants ou un CMS (Wix, WordPress, etc.) en ajustant seulement les couleurs ou quelques éléments de mise en page.  
    Mon approche n’utilise aucun template. La mise en page, la structure et la présentation visuelle sont créées entièrement à partir de zéro — une approche très proche du “full custom”.
  </p>

  <h3>Pourquoi ne pas faire du 100 % sur mesure ?</h3>
  <p>
    Les portfolios d’artistes n’ont pas besoin de CMS complexes ni de plugins, qui rendent souvent les sites plus lourds et fragiles.  
    En créant uniquement ce qui est nécessaire, on obtient un site léger, stable et durable, bien moins susceptible de “se casser”.
  </p>
  <h3>Pourquoi parle-t-on de « frais d’assistance à la création » et non de « frais de création » ?</h3>
<p>
  Ce service est conçu pour réduire la dépendance entre vous et moi dans la gestion à long terme du site.  
  Ainsi, tous les fichiers du code et le compte GitHub sont <strong>entièrement votre propriété</strong> dès le départ.
</p>
<p>
  Vous êtes responsable de la direction artistique de votre site,  
  tandis que moi, je fournis les propositions et le support technique nécessaires pour réaliser cette vision.
</p>
<p>
  Autrement dit, le site n’est pas quelque chose que je « crée pour vous », mais  
  <strong>une co-création entre vous et moi</strong>.  
  C’est pourquoi ce coût est défini comme des « frais d’assistance à la création » et non comme des frais de création classiques.
</p>


  <h3>Qui est propriétaire du site ?</h3>
  <p>Vous. Le compte GitHub et le code sont à votre nom.</p>

  <h3>Le renouvellement après 2 ans est-il obligatoire ? Et quand a-t-il lieu ?</h3>
  <p>
    Non, il est optionnel. Même sans renouvellement, votre site reste en ligne.  
    Je vous contacterai un mois avant la fin de votre période de support.
  </p>

  <h3>Que comprend la mise à jour gratuite ?</h3>
  <p>Jusqu’à deux petites mises à jour par semaine (ajout, remplacement d’images, correction de légendes, etc.).</p>

  <h3>Est-il possible que Natsuki arrête ce service un jour ?</h3>
  <p>
    Oui, c’est possible.  
    Mon activité principale est le maquillage artistique, et il se peut qu’un jour mon emploi du temps ne me permette plus de continuer.  
    En cas d’arrêt, je vous préviendrai au moins <strong>6 mois à l’avance</strong>.
  </p>

  <h3>Et y a-t-il un risque que vous arrêtiez juste après la livraison de mon site ?</h3>
  <p>
    Non, aucun risque.  
    Je garantirai <strong>les 2 premières années de support</strong> après la livraison.  
    C’est un engagement essentiel du service, et sauf circonstances exceptionnelles (accident, maladie grave, etc.), je n’interromprai pas le support.  
    Vous pouvez utiliser les deux premières années en toute tranquillité.
  </p>

  <p>
    Votre site est hébergé sur votre propre GitHub et vous appartient entièrement.  
    Vous pouvez continuer à l’utiliser ou le confier à un autre designer si nécessaire.
  </p>

  <h3>Puis-je confier le site à un autre designer ou faire modifier le code ?</h3>
  <p>
    Oui. Le site vous appartient, vous pouvez donc travailler avec le designer de votre choix.
  </p>
  <p>
    En revanche, un code modifié par quelqu’un d’autre peut différer de ma structure.  
    En cas de problème, <strong>les mêmes conditions de support peuvent ne pas s’appliquer</strong>. Merci de me consulter d’abord.
  </p>
  <p>
    Si une erreur provient d’une modification externe, l’assistance sera traitée au cas par cas (frais supplémentaires), selon la situation.
  </p>

  <h3>Et si je n’ai jamais utilisé GitHub ?</h3>
  <p>
    Aucun problème.  
    Nous créerons le compte ensemble en vérifiant chaque étape.  
    Je m’occupe de toute la configuration technique et de la mise en ligne.  
    Vous n’aurez pas à toucher au code.
  </p>

  <h3>Comment envoyer mes nouvelles images ?</h3>
  <p>
    Il suffit d’envoyer vos images, légendes et crédits par DM ou email.  
    Cela fait partie des “2 mises à jour par semaine”.
  </p>

  <h3>Combien d’images puis-je mettre ?</h3>
  <p>
    Il n’y a pas de limite technique.  
    Toutefois, trop d’images peuvent diluer votre univers visuel.  
    Nous ajusterons ensemble le nombre idéal.
  </p>

  <h3>Et si je veux changer la structure après la livraison du site ?</h3>
  <p>
    Les petites modifications sont possibles.  
    Les refontes importantes (nouvelles catégories, réagencement complexe) seront considérées comme un nouveau travail.
  </p>

  <h3>Pouvez-vous créer un deuxième site semi-custom pour moi ?</h3>
  <p>
    Cela dépendra de ma disponibilité.  
    Contactez-moi d'abord.
  </p>

  <h3>Les droits d’utilisation des photos sont-ils en règle ?</h3>
  <p>
    Je pars du principe que le client possède les droits nécessaires.  
    La responsabilité concernant les droits d’auteur incombe au client (vous), et non au créateur du site.
  </p>

  <h3>Le site est-il optimisé pour le SEO ?</h3>
  <p>
    Un SEO avancé n’est pas indispensable pour un portfolio d’artiste, mais  
    les métadonnées essentielles et la structure sont correctement mises en place.  
    Ce site n’est pas conçu pour “être trouvé par tout le monde”,  
    mais pour <strong>toucher précisément les personnes à qui vous souhaitez montrer votre travail</strong>.
  </p>
  <h3>Q. Les contenus du service ou son fonctionnement peuvent-ils évoluer à l’avenir ?</h3> 
  <p> A. Oui. Afin de garantir un accompagnement de qualité, les contenus du service, les politiques ainsi que certains tarifs peuvent être réévalués et ajustés. Dans ce cas, les clients utilisant déjà le service seront informés au préalable, et les modifications ne seront appliquées qu’après leur compréhension et leur accord. </p>

  <h2>Message de fin</h2>

  <p>
    Merci d’avoir pris le temps de lire tout cela jusqu’au bout.  
    À l’origine, tout est parti d’un besoin personnel — créer mon propre portfolio —  
    mais j’ai vite réalisé que beaucoup d’artistes autour de moi rencontraient  
    exactement les mêmes difficultés.
  </p>

  <p>
    J’ai voulu créer quelque chose de petit, sincère et utile :  
    une manière de soutenir les amis en qui j’ai confiance,  
    et de nous aider, chacun à notre manière,  
    à avancer plus sereinement dans nos parcours artistiques.
  </p>

  <p>
    C’est cette intention qui a donné naissance à ce projet —  
    ce système de soutien en petit comité que j’appelle  
    <strong>« Artists on Website »</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Il ne s’agit pas d’un projet destiné à s’agrandir ou à devenir un business.  
    C’est simplement une structure claire, transparente,  
    que je partage avec les artistes auxquels je tiens vraiment.
  </p>

  <p>
    Si ce projet peut devenir, même modestement,  
    un petit coup de pouce dans votre parcours créatif,  
    j’en serais profondément heureux.

  <h2>イントロダクション</h2>

  <p>私はフリーランスのメイクアップアーティストです。Wix、Format、Cargo といった既存のサービスや、一般的な“ウェブ制作会社”の仕組みに満足できなかったため、自分のポートフォリオサイトをゼロから作りました。</p>

  <p>とくにヘアメイクのような個人ポートフォリオにおいては、多くのウェブサービスはオーバースペックです。料金が高すぎたり、構造が複雑すぎたり、デザイナーや制作会社への依存度が大きすぎたりします。</p>

  <p>さまざまなサイトサービスを試しても不満が解消されず、最終的に自分でコードを学ぶことを決めました。ちょうど AI 技術が大きく進化したタイミングでもあり、私のような初心者レベルのプログラマーでも、クリーンで安定した、エージェンシー並みのポートフォリオサイトを作れる時代になりました。そして、コストの透明性・使いやすさ・長期的な維持のしやすさという点では、多くのプロのウェブデザイナー以上のものを提供できていると感じています。</p>

  <p>コード、モダンなツール、そして AI。この組み合わせのおかげで、私自身にも、そして身近なアーティスト仲間にも、最大限シンプルで透明性があり、コントロールしやすい仕組みを用意できるようになりました。競争の激しいパリという街で、毎日現場で戦うインディペンデントなアーティストにとって、これはヘアメイクの仕事に最適化された、ひとつの“最良の選択肢”になっていると思います。</p>
  <p class="intro-sign"> Natsuki Oneyama</p>

<section id="about-service-ja">
  <h2>このサービスについて</h2>

  <p>このサービスは、ビジネス拡大を目的としたものではなく、私が個人的に信頼している友人だけを対象にした「人数限定のサイト制作補助サービス」です。最大の特徴は、<strong>完全少人数制（最大10名）</strong>であること。大量生産はせず、私のキャパシティとクオリティを保つためにも、この人数以上は受けません。そのぶん、誰かと同じテンプレートにはならず、セミカスタムでありながら、フルカスタムに近いクオリティを持つ“あなた専用のオリジナルサイト”を、一人ひとりに合わせて提供することができます。</p>

  <p>私はウェブ制作会社ではありません。ただ、ランニングコストや依存関係をできるだけ減らしながら、エージェンシー基準のクオリティと、あなた自身を一人のアーティストとして正しく魅力的に表現できるクラスのポートフォリオ作りをお手伝いするだけです。</p>

  <p>私自身のポートフォリオサイト<a href="https://natsukioneyama.com" target="_blank">natsukioneyama.com</a>も、自分でコードを書き、GitHub を使って構築したものです。このサービスで提供している仕組みが、実際の現場で問題なく機能していることの具体的な例になっています。</p>

<section id="github-ja">
  <h2>GitHub について – 仕組みと所有権</h2>

  <p>
    GitHub は Microsoft 傘下の、世界最大級のソースコード管理プラットフォームです。
    世界中のエンジニアやデザイナーがプロジェクトを公開・共有する場所であり、
    信頼性・高速性・安定性の面で現在もっとも強力な無料ホスティング環境のひとつです。
  </p>

  <h3>ホスティングとは？</h3>
  <p>
    あなたのサイトのファイル（HTML / CSS / JS など）をインターネット上のサーバーに置き、
    誰でもアクセスできるようにする仕組みのことです。多くの人が「サーバー契約」や「管理費」を
    イメージしますが、GitHub Pages はこれを<strong>完全無料</strong>で提供します。もちろんアカウントも無料で作成できます。

  </p>

  <h3>プロのウェブデザイナーも使用する時代</h3>
  <p>
    近年では多くのプロのウェブデザイナーが、自分のクライアントサイトを GitHub Pages で構築しています。
    理由はシンプルで、次のような条件を満たしているからです。
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>高速</li>
    <li>安定</li>
    <li>セキュア</li>
    <li>ランニングコストゼロ</li>
    <li>長期的に壊れにくい</li>
    <li>依存がない（オーナーは常にあなた）</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>制作会社や一般のデザイナーとの違い</h3>
  <p>
    たとえ GitHub を使っていても、一般的なデザイナーや制作会社では「管理費」「維持費」という名目で
    毎月または毎年の料金が発生するケースがほとんどです。
  </p>
  <p>
    ですが私の仕組みでは、<strong>あなた名義の GitHub アカウント上にサイトを構築し、所有権も完全にあなたのもの</strong>です。
    あなたのアカウントが存在する限り、サイトはずっとあなたの資産として残ります。
  </p>

  <h3>この方法が最適である理由</h3>
  <p>
    アーティストのポートフォリオは、過剰な機能も、大規模サーバーも必要ありません。むしろ次のような条件を満たす方が、
    現実的で強いポートフォリオになります。
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>軽い</li>
    <li>壊れにくい</li>
    <li>高速</li>
    <li>管理が簡単</li>
    <li>誰にも依存しない</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    私はこの仕組みを使うことで、「長期的に安心して使えるエージェンシー基準のサイト」を、
    最小限のコストで作ることができると考えています。
  </p>
</section>


<section id="concept-ja">
  <h2>基本コンセプト</h2>

  <p>
    私が提供するサイトは、シンプルで視認性の高いポートフォリオ構造をベースにしています。
    ヘアメイクの仕事は「作品をどう見せるか」がすべてのため、無駄な装飾を排し、
    スクロールするだけで世界観と技術が伝わるように設計しています。
  </p>

  <p>
    しかし、私の友人のアーティストたちは皆、個性的で野心家です。
    今のポジションに満足せず、常に自分らしい表現を追求している人ばかりです。
    たとえクライアント用のブックを既に持っていたとしても、
    あなたが「見せたい」と思うイメージをそのままの形で表現し、
    パーソナルプロジェクトや、あなたのバックボーンとなる日々のクリエーションまで
    最適な見せ方で届けられる場所は、実は多くありません。
  </p>

  <p>
    私は、それこそがアーティスト個人のポートフォリオサイトの本質だと考えています。
    あなたの希望通りの見せ方で、あなたの世界観をそのままに、
    現実的なコストで、無駄なく、そしてあなた自身のペースで更新できる形で実現する——
    それが私が提案するこのサービスです。
  </p>

<section id="pricing-ja">
  <h2>料金 – 制作補助費（1200€）</h2>

  <p>このサービスは、<strong>最大10名限定</strong>の小規模な制作補助サービスです。</p>

  <p><strong>制作補助費：1200€（制作＋初回2年間のサポート込み）</strong></p>

  <p>
    1200€ は、初回の制作費と2年間の運用サポートを含んだ金額です。月あたりに換算すると約 <strong>50€ / 月</strong> 程度で運用できます。プロのアーティストが現場で実際に使うためのポートフォリオとして、維持費を抑えつつ長く使える設計になっています。
  </p>
  <p>加えて、</p>
  <p>・ GitHub Pages を使用するためサーバー費用は無料</p>
  <p>・ ランニングコストはあなたが所有する独自ドメインの年間費のみ</p>
  <p>・ 2年後以降は必要に応じてサポート更新（100€ / 2年）</p>

  <div class="summary-inner">
    <p class="summary-label">つまり、</p>
    <p class="summary-main">
      → 1200€＋独自ドメイン費だけで、あなた専用サイトを長期運用できます。
    </p>
  </div>
</div>


  <p>1200€ に含まれるもの：</p>
  <ul>
    <li>１ポートフォリオサイト（作品・方向性に合わせた最適な見せ方を提案）</li>
    <li>スマホ・タブレット・PC に対応したレスポンシブ実装</li>
    <li>あなた名義の GitHub アカウント上でサイトを構築し、GitHub Pages にて公開</li>
    <li>独自ドメインをすでに所有している場合の接続設定、または新規取得時の設定サポート</li>
    <li>初回の画像・キャプション・クレジットの流し込みとバランス調整</li>
    <li>納品後2年間のアフターケア（週2回までの小さな更新：画像追加・差し替え、テキスト修正など）</li>
  </ul>
</section>


<section id="market-facts-ja">
  <h2>ウェブ制作の相場について</h2>

  <p>1200€という数字だけを見ると高く感じるかもしれませんが、実際のウェブ制作の相場を見てみると、この金額は“むしろ抑えめ”であることがわかります。</p>

  <h3>プロのデザイナーに依頼した場合のざっくり内訳イメージ</h3>
  <p>たとえば、ヘアメイク用のシンプルなポートフォリオサイト、例えばoverview＋lightbox（全作品の一覧と、作品を拡大して見せるギャラリー表示）を、フリーランスのウェブデザイナーに依頼した場合のイメージです。</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>ヒアリング・構成設計：</strong> 200〜400€（サイトマップ作成、どこに何を載せるかの整理）</li>
    <li><strong>デザイン（トップ＋overviewページ＋簡単なテキストページ）：</strong> 400〜700€</li>
    <li><strong>コーディング（HTML / CSS / JavaScript、レスポンシブ対応）：</strong> 400〜800€</li>
    <li><strong>overview ギャラリー実装＋ lightbox 組み込みと調整：</strong> 300〜500€</li>
    <li><strong>サーバー設定・ドメイン接続・最終チェック：</strong> 150〜300€</li>
  </ul>

  <p>このくらいを合計すると、内容にもよりますが<strong>おおよそ 1500〜2700€</strong>くらいになるケースが多いです（フランスやヨーロッパのフリーランス相場をベースにした目安）。</p>

  <h3>月々の管理費（メンテナンス費）について</h3>
  <p>さらに、制作会社や一部のフリーランスでは、</p>
  <ul>
    <li>サーバー・ドメイン費用</li>
    <li>セキュリティやバックアップ</li>
    <li>小さなテキスト修正や画像差し替え</li>
  </ul>
  <p>といった名目で、<strong>毎月30〜100€前後の管理費・保守費</strong>が発生するプランが一般的です。規模や内容次第では、もっと高額な保守契約になることもあります。</p>

  <p>このように、ウェブサイトの制作と運用は、思っている以上にコストがかかります。とくにポートフォリオはアーティストにとって“仕事道具”ですし、エージェンシーに所属していても、そのサイトに満足できるとは限りません。</p>

  <p>だからこそ、初回制作1200€（2年間のサポート込み）は、長期的に見ると現実的で、維持費の読める選択肢として位置づけています。2年分の基本的な更新サポートまで含めて「ここまで」で完結する料金体系にすることで、予算が読みやすくなるようにしています。</p>
</section>


<section id="compare-ja">
  <h2>他の選択肢 – ホームページビルディングサービス</h2>

  <h3>Wix / Format / Cargo などのサービスについて</h3>
  <p>
    これらのサービスは、テンプレートを選んで簡単にサイトを作れる「サイトビルダー型」のツールです。
    手軽さや即時性は魅力ですが、長期的なポートフォリオ運用という観点では、いくつかの制限があります。
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>テンプレートの “型” から抜け出しにくく、デザインの自由度が限られる</li>
    <li>画像の見せ方やレイアウトに細かなこだわりを反映しにくい</li>
    <li>年間200〜300€前後の固定費（月額・年額）が継続的に発生する</li>
    <li>テンプレートやサービス側のアップデートによるデザイン変化が起きる可能性</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    とくにヘアメイクのように “作品の見せ方” が成果に直結する職業の場合、
    テンプレート特有のクセや自由度の低さが、作品の印象や選ばれ方に影響することがあります。
  </p>

  <h3>私が提供する GitHub ベースの仕組みとの違い</h3>
  <p>
    私のサービスは「あなたの作品が一番美しく見えること」を最優先に、
    必要最低限のコードと GitHub Pages（無料）を使って構築します。
    サイトはあなた自身のアカウント上で動くため、制作者(私)への依存がありません。
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>維持費ゼロ</strong>（サーバー代・管理費が発生しない）</li>
    <li><strong>オーナーは常にあなた</strong> – コードもリポジトリもあなた名義</li>
    <li><strong>軽くて高速</strong> – 写真ポートフォリオに最適化された構造</li>
    <li><strong>余計な機能なし</strong> – 必要なものだけで構成し、ブレがない</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    作品中心のポートフォリオにとって、軽量で壊れにくい静的サイトは非常に相性が良く、
    長期的に見てもコストと運用のストレスが最も少ない選択肢になります。

<section id="payment-flow-ja">
  <h2>制作と支払いの流れ</h2>

  <p>このサービスは、できる限りスムーズで明確なプロセスで進行します。最初のヒアリングからサイト公開までの流れは以下の通りです。</p>

  <h3>1. 方向性のヒアリング</h3>
  <p>
    まず、あなたのポートフォリオサイトの方向性を一緒に確認します。  
    現在の立ち位置、見せたいイメージ、カテゴリ構成、全体の世界観などを共有し、最適なレイアウトやサイト構造を決めていきます。
  </p>

  <h3>2. 素材（画像・テキスト）の送付</h3>
  <p>
    ヒアリング後、クライアント側で掲載したい写真・キャプション・クレジットなどを送っていただきます。  
    すでに構成が固まっている場合はそのまま、まだ整理が必要な場合は流れを一緒に整えます。
  </p>

  <h3>3. ウェブ制作開始</h3>
  <p>
    素材がそろい次第、私がコーディングとレイアウト調整を開始します。  
    Overview・Lightbox・カテゴリ構成・必要なテキストページなどを組み込み、あなた専用のポートフォリオサイトを構築していきます。
  </p>

  <h3>4. テストリンクで仮公開</h3>
  <p>
    完成後、まずは GitHub Pages 上にテスト用リンクとして仮公開します。  
    実際にスマホ・タブレット・PC で動作を確認し、画像の並びやキャプションなどに問題がないか、一緒にチェックします。
  </p>

  <h3>5. クライアントの最終確認と承認</h3>
  <p>
    修正点があれば反映し、最終版が問題なければ「承認」をいただきます。  
    このタイミングで制作が完了したことになり、支払いに進みます。
  </p>

<h3>6. 支払い</h3>
<p>
  テストリンクを共有したあと、スマートフォン・PC などでゆっくり内容を確認していただきます。    
  内容に問題がなければ「承認」をいただき、制作補助費（1200€）をお支払いください。
</p>

<h3>7. 支払い確認後、ドメイン接続・本公開</h3>
<p>
  支払い確認後、あなたが指定した独自ドメインにサイトを紐づけ、本公開します。  
  公開後は正式なポートフォリオとして機能し、この時点で制作工程は完了です。
</p>

<p>
  公開後、数日経ってから気づくような軽微な不具合（画像の表示崩れ、小さなレイアウト調整など）があれば、  
  これらは<strong>無償修正</strong>にて対応しますのでご安心ください。
</p>

</section>

<section id="return-policy-ja">
  <h2>リターンポリシー（キャンセル・返金について）</h2>

  <p>
    このサービスは、私が信頼している友人に向けた「完全成功報酬」の制作サポートです。  
    サイトの完成版（テストリンク）を実際に確認していただいてから、お支払いをお願いしています。
  </p>

  <h3>キャンセルについて</h3>
  <p>
    進行が難しくなった場合や方向性が変わった場合は、どの段階でもキャンセル可能です。  
    その際は、作業状況の共有のためにも、できるだけ早めにご連絡ください。
  </p>

  <h3>承認後の返金について</h3>
<p>
  テストリンク確認後に「承認」をいただいた時点で、制作は完了となります。  
  承認後のクライアント事情による返金は、<strong>私のコーディングに修正不可能な重大なミスがある場合を除き</strong>、お受けできません。
</p>

<p>
  公開後に数日経ってから気づくような軽微な不具合（表示のズレ・画像配置の微調整など）は、  
  <strong>返金ではなく無償修正</strong>にて対応します。  
  これは静的サイト特有のブラウザ差などによって起こり得る一般的なケースです。
</p>

<h3>外部要因による不具合について</h3>
<p>
  iOS・ブラウザ・GitHub の仕様変更など、  
  <strong>外部要因による変化や不具合は返金対象外</strong>です。  
  必要に応じて可能な範囲でサポートします。

<section id="faq-ja">
  <h2>FAQ</h2>

  <!-- サイト種別・カスタム範囲 -->
  <h3>これはフルカスタムですか？</h3>
  <p>基本はセミカスタムサイトです。ただし最終的な仕上がりは、ほぼフルカスタムに近いクオリティになります。</p>

  <h3>フルカスタムとセミカスタムの違いはなんですか？</h3>
  <p>
    一般的なセミカスタムは、既存テンプレートや CMS（Wix・WordPress など）をベースに、色や配置だけを調整する方式です。
    私のサイトはテンプレートを使用せず、レイアウトや画像の見せ方までゼロから作る “フルカスタム寄り” の制作です。
  </p>

  <h3>なぜフルカスタムにしないのですか？</h3>
  <p>
    アーティストのポートフォリオでは複雑な CMS やプラグインは不要であり、むしろ重く壊れやすくなります。
    必要な部分だけをゼロから設計することで、軽くて壊れにくい、長期保守に強いサイトを実現しています。
  </p>
  <h3>なぜ「制作費」ではなく「制作補助費」なのですか？</h3>
<p>
  このサービスは、お客様と私の間に生まれるサイト運営上の依存関係を減らすことを目的としています。  
  そのため、サイトのコードファイルと GitHub アカウントはすべて<strong>お客様自身の所有物</strong>となる設計です。
</p>
<p>
  お客様はサイト制作のアートディレクションを担当し、  
  私はそのビジョンを実現するための提案と技術的サポートを行います。
</p>
<p>
  つまり、サイト制作は「私が作るもの」ではなく、  
  <strong>お客様と私による共同制作</strong>という位置づけです。  
  そのため、この料金は “制作費” ではなく “制作補助費” としています。
</p>


  <!-- 所有・更新・サポート -->
  <h3>サイトの所有者は誰ですか？</h3>
  <p>常にあなたです。GitHub のアカウントもコードもあなた名義です。</p>

  <h3>2年後の更新は必須ですか？ また、更新時期はいつですか？</h3>
  <p>
    いいえ、更新は任意です。更新しなくてもサイトはそのまま残ります。  
    更新のご案内は、サポート期間の終了1ヶ月前にお知らせします。
  </p>

  <h3>無料更新の範囲は？</h3>
  <p>週2回までの小さな更新（画像追加・差し替え・キャプション修正など）です。</p>

  <h3>Natsuki がこのサービスをやめることはありますか？</h3>
  <p>
    はい、あります。  
    私の本業はメイクアップアーティストで、将来的に忙しくなり継続が難しくなる可能性があります。
    終了する場合は <strong>6ヶ月前</strong>までに必ずお知らせします。
  </p>
  <h3>では、サイト納品後すぐにこのサービスをやめてしまう可能性はありますか？</h3>
<p>
  いいえ、その心配はありません。  
  納品後の<strong>初回2年間のサポートは必ず履行します</strong>。  
  これはサービスの根幹であり、私自身に重大な事情（事故・病気など）がない限り、途中で放棄することはありません。  
  初回の2年間については、安心してご利用いただけます。
</p>

  <p>
    サイトはあなたの GitHub 上にあり、完全にあなたの所有物です。  
    そのまま使い続けることも、他のデザイナーに引き継ぐこともできます。
  </p>

  <!-- 他者コード・引き継ぎ -->
<h3>他のデザイナーに引き継いだり、コードを修正してもらっても大丈夫ですか？</h3>
<p>
  はい、大丈夫です。サイトデータはあなたの所有物なので、他のデザイナーに依頼しても問題ありません。
</p>
<p>
  ただし、他の方が書き換えたコードは私の構造と異なる場合があります。  
  不具合が生じた際に、<strong>同じ条件でのサポートができない可能性</strong>がありますので、まずはご相談ください。
</p>
<p>
  他者の改修が原因となるエラーは、内容に応じて個別相談（別料金）となりますので、まずはご相談ください。
</p>

  <!-- 更新方法・写真関連 -->
  <h3>GitHub を触ったことがなくても大丈夫ですか？</h3>
  <p>
   はい、大丈夫です。  
   GitHub のアカウントは、必要なステップを一緒に確認しながら作成しますのでご安心ください。  
   公開までの設定や難しい部分は、こちらでサポートします。  
   クライアント側でコードを触る必要はありません。
  </p>


  <h3>写真の差し替えや追加はどうすればいいですか？</h3>
  <p>
    画像・キャプション・クレジットは DM やメールで送るだけで大丈夫です。  
    週2回までの更新サポートに含まれています。
  </p>

  <h3>画像は何枚まで載せられますか？</h3>
  <p>
    技術的な制限はありません。  
    ただし、作品が多すぎると世界観が薄まるので、最適な枚数は一緒に調整します。
  </p>

  <h3>サイト完成後に「やっぱり構成を変えたい」と思ったら？</h3>
  <p>
    小さな変更は可能です。  
    大規模な構造変更（カテゴリ追加・レイアウト再設計）は、内容に応じて新規作業として相談になります。
  </p>

  <h3>このポートフォリオとは別に、二つ目のセミカスタムサイトも作れますか？</h3>
  <p>
    可能な場合もありますが、私の状況によります。  
    希望される場合は、まずはご相談ください。
  </p>

  <!-- 著作権・SEO -->
  <h3>掲載写真の著作権は大丈夫ですか？</h3>
  <p>
    クライアントが使用許可のある写真を前提としています。  
    著作権に関する責任はクライアント側(あなた)にあり、制作者には発生しません。
  </p>

  <h3>SEO は対応していますか？</h3>
  <p>
    アーティストのポートフォリオでは高度な SEO は不要ですが、  
    最低限のメタ情報や構造は整えています。  
    このサイトは「広く検索されるため」ではなく、  
    <strong>見せたい相手にしっかり届くためのポートフォリオ</strong>です。
  </p>
   <h3>Q. 今後、サービスの内容や仕組みが変わる可能性はありますか？</h3>
  <p>
  A. はい。より良いサポート体制を整えるため、各種料金を含めサービス内容やポリシーを見直す場合があります。ただし、その時点でご利用中のクライアントさまには、必ず事前に詳細をご説明し、ご理解・ご承認をいただいた後に適用いたします。
