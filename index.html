  <section id="intro">
    <h2>Introduction</h2> 
    <p>I am a freelance makeup artist. After trying services like Wix, Format, and Cargo, as well as the typical “web production company” model, I could never find a system that truly fit the needs of an individual artist’s portfolio.</p>
    <p>Especially for hair and makeup artists, most web services are simply too much—too expensive, too complex, or too dependent on external designers and production companies.</p> 
    <p>After testing multiple platforms and still feeling unsatisfied, I eventually decided to learn how to code and build my own site from scratch. I started at the perfect moment: just as AI tools were rapidly evolving. This made it possible—even for someone like me, with only beginner-level programming skills—to create a clean, stable, agency-quality portfolio website.</p> 
    <p>In terms of cost transparency, usability, and long-term stability, I now feel that this approach offers more control and clarity than many professional web designers can provide.</p> 
    <p>Thanks to a combination of hand-written code, modern tools, and AI, I can now offer a system that is simple, transparent, and easy to maintain—not only for myself, but also for the artists around me. For independent creatives working every day in a competitive city like Paris, this has become one of the most practical and efficient options available for maintaining a strong, reliable portfolio.</p> 
    <p class="intro-sign">Natsuki Oneyama</p>
  </section>

  <section id="about-service">
    <h2>About This Service</h2>

    <p>
      This is not a commercial web design business.  
      It is a small, invitation-only support service for a small group of friends I personally trust.
    </p>

    <p>
      I do not mass-produce websites.  
      Keeping the group small allows me to maintain quality, care, and proper communication.  
      Even though the structure is “semi-custom,” the final result is very close to a fully custom, artist-specific website—something that does not look like anyone else’s template.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am not a web agency.  
      I simply help reduce unnecessary costs and dependencies while providing a clean, stable, agency-level portfolio that expresses you accurately as an artist.
    </p>

    <p>
      My own portfolio <a href="https://natsukioneyama.com" target="_blank">natsukioneyama.com</a> is built entirely by hand, using custom code and GitHub.  
      The system I offer here is the same one I use for my professional work, and it has proven reliable in real-world conditions.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="limit">
    <h2>Limited & Friends-Only Service</h2>

    <p>This service is not publicly offered.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>It is only available to makeup/hair artists I personally know.</li>
      <li>People I trust and want to stay connected with long-term.</li>
      <li>Artists who genuinely need a professional portfolio website.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The scale is intentionally kept small so that I can maintain quality,
      communication, and long-term support for each person.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="github">
    <h2>About GitHub – How It Works & Who Owns the Site</h2>

    <p>
      GitHub is a Microsoft-owned platform and one of the largest code-hosting
      services in the world. It is where millions of developers and designers
      store, share, and publish their projects. In terms of reliability,
      speed, and stability, it is one of the strongest free hosting environments
      available today.
    </p>

    <h3>What is “hosting”?</h3>
    <p>
      Hosting simply means placing your site files (HTML / CSS / JavaScript, etc.)
      on an online server so anyone can access your website.  
      Many people imagine paid servers or monthly contracts,  
      but GitHub Pages provides hosting <strong>completely for free</strong>.  
      Creating an account is also free.
    </p>

    <h3>Why many professional designers use GitHub today</h3>
    <p>
      In recent years, more and more professional web designers have started  
      building client websites on GitHub Pages.  
      The reason is simple — it meets all the essential conditions:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Fast</li>
      <li>Stable</li>
      <li>Secure</li>
      <li>No running costs</li>
      <li>Hard to break</li>
      <li>No dependency (the owner is always you)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How this differs from design studios and standard freelancers</h3>
    <p>
      Even if a designer uses GitHub, most studios or freelancers will still charge  
      “maintenance fees” or “management fees” every month or every year.
    </p>

    <p>
      But in my system, the site is built directly inside  
      <strong>your own GitHub account</strong>, and the code is  
      <strong>100% owned by you</strong>.  
      As long as your GitHub account exists, the site remains your asset forever.
    </p>

    <h3>Why this method is ideal for artist portfolios</h3>
    <p>
      Portfolio sites do not need heavy features or large servers.  
      In reality, the best portfolio is one that is:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Lightweight</li>
      <li>Stable and hard to break</li>
      <li>Fast</li>
      <li>Easy to maintain</li>
      <li>Independent of any designer or company</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Using this structure allows me to create  
      a long-lasting, agency-level portfolio site with  
      minimal cost and maximum control for the artist.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="concept">
    <h2>Core Concept</h2>

    <p>
      The portfolio sites I create are built on a simple, highly visual structure.  
      In the hair & makeup profession, everything depends on “how the work is shown.”
      That’s why the design removes unnecessary decoration and focuses on clarity —
      allowing your world, technique, and aesthetic to be communicated simply
      through scrolling.
    </p>

    <p>
      Many of my artist friends are individualistic and ambitious.
      They are not satisfied with staying where they are — they continue to push
      their personal expression, whether through client work, personal projects,
      or day-to-day creative exploration.
      Even if you already have a client-facing portfolio or agency book,  
      there are very few places where you can present  
      the images you *want* to show, exactly the way you want to show them,
      including personal and experimental work that forms your true foundation.
    </p>

    <p>
      I believe this is the true purpose of a personal artist portfolio.  
      A place where your world can be shown as it is — without compromise,
      without unnecessary restrictions, and in a format that supports your pace
      and your long-term direction.
    </p>

    <p>
      What I offer is a practical, cost-efficient way to express your work  
      exactly as you envision it:  
      clean, simple, visually strong, and structured for real creative careers.
    </p>

  <section id="pricing">
    <h2>Pricing – Production Assistance Fee (1200€)</h2>

    <p><strong>Production Assistance Fee: 1200€ (includes creation + the first 2 years of support)</strong></p>

    <p>
      The 1200€ fee includes the initial creation of your portfolio website and 2 years of operational support. 
      When converted monthly, the cost is approximately <strong>50€ / month</strong>. 
      It is designed to be a long-lasting, low-maintenance portfolio solution suitable for professional artists working on real projects.
    </p>

    <p>Additionally,</p>
    <p>・ Using GitHub Pages means there are no server hosting costs</p>
    <p>・ Your only running cost is the annual fee for your own custom domain</p>
    <p>・ After the first 2 years, optional support renewal is available (100€ / 2 years)</p>

    <div class="summary-outer">
      <div class="summary-inner">

  </section>

  <section id="market-facts">
    <h2>Market Facts – What Website Production Usually Costs</h2>

    <p>
      At first glance, 1200€ may seem high.  
      But when you look at the actual market rates for portfolio websites,
      this price is actually on the lower end.
    </p>

    <h3>Approximate breakdown when hiring a professional web designer</h3>
    <p>
      For a simple hair & makeup portfolio site — for example, an overview page plus a lightbox gallery —
      the typical cost from a freelance designer in Europe looks something like this:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Consultation & structure planning:</strong> 200–400€  
        (site map, deciding what goes where)
      </li>
      <li><strong>Design (top page + overview + basic info page):</strong> 400–700€</li>
      <li><strong>Coding (HTML / CSS / JavaScript, responsive layout):</strong> 400–800€</li>
      <li><strong>Overview gallery + lightbox implementation:</strong> 300–500€</li>
      <li><strong>Server setup, domain connection, final checks:</strong> 150–300€</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Altogether, this usually comes to around  
      <strong>1500–2700€</strong>, depending on the project and designer.
    </p>

    <h3>Monthly “maintenance fees”</h3>
    <p>
      Many designers and production companies also charge monthly or annual fees for:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Server & domain management</li>
      <li>Security updates or backups</li>
      <li>Small text or image updates</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These maintenance plans typically cost  
      <strong>30–100€ per month</strong>, sometimes more depending on the provider.
    </p>

    <p>
      In reality, website creation and maintenance add up quickly — especially for artists,  
      whose portfolio is part of their professional identity and daily work.
    </p>

    <p>
      That is why the one-time creation fee of 1200€ (including two years of support)  
      is designed to be a realistic and predictable option.  
      Everything essential is included upfront, with no hidden running costs.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="compare">
    <h2>Other Options – Website Builder Services</h2>

    <h3>About Wix / Format / Cargo and similar platforms</h3>
    <p>
      These tools are “website builders” where you choose a template and assemble your site visually.
      They are convenient and quick, but for long-term portfolio use, especially for image-driven artists,
      there are several limitations.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Design freedom is limited by the template’s structure</li>
      <li>Difficult to fully customize image layout or presentation style</li>
      <li>Ongoing subscription fees (usually 200–300€ per year)</li>
      <li>Your layout may change when the service updates their templates</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      For professions where “how the work is presented” is crucial — such as hair & makeup —
      these template limitations can directly affect the impression your work makes.
    </p>

    <h3>How my GitHub-based approach differs</h3>
    <p>
      The system I provide is built around one priority:  
      <strong>your work should look its absolute best.</strong><br>
      Using lightweight code and GitHub Pages (free), the site is designed to be fast, stable,
      and completely independent.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>No running costs</strong> (no hosting fee, no maintenance contracts)</li>
      <li><strong>You are the owner</strong> — the code and repository belong to your GitHub account</li>
      <li><strong>Fast and lightweight</strong> — ideal for photo-heavy portfolios</li>
      <li><strong>No unnecessary features</strong> — only what is needed to showcase your work</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      For artist portfolios, a lightweight static site is often the strongest and least stressful choice,
      both creatively and financially.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="aftercare">
    <h2>Aftercare – The First Two Years</h2>

    <p>
      During the first two years, you can request up to two small updates per week  
      (image additions, replacements, caption or text edits). These are included at no extra cost.
    </p>

    <p>
      Larger structural changes — such as adding new categories or redesigning layouts —
      will be treated as new tasks and discussed separately.
    </p>

    <p>
      Any issues present at the moment of delivery (display glitches, broken links, layout errors)
      are fully my responsibility and will be fixed free of charge.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, issues caused by <strong>external factors</strong> after delivery — such as updates to iOS,
      browser changes, new device screen sizes, or unexpected changes in GitHub’s behavior —  
      fall outside the creator’s responsibility.
    </p>

    <p>
      When these external changes cause display issues, I will still check the situation and,
      whenever possible, help fix the problem.  
      Depending on the amount of work required, this may lead to an additional fee, discussed case by case.
    </p>

    <p>
      This service is intended only for friends I trust and want to support for the long term.  
      I aim to help as much as possible while keeping a structure that is fair for both sides.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="renewal">
    <h2>Support Renewal – Optional</h2>

    <p>
      After the initial two years, your site will remain online exactly as it is.  
      If you would like me to continue handling small updates and maintenance,
      you can choose the optional renewal plan:
    </p>

    <p><strong>Support Renewal: €100 / 2 years</strong></p>

    <p>
      Should there come a time when I can no longer offer support,
      I will notify you at least six months before the end of your current support period.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="payment-flow">
    <h2>Production & Payment Flow</h2>

    <p>
      This project follows a clear and simple process.  
      From the first conversation to the final launch, the workflow goes as follows:
    </p>

    <h3>1. Direction Meeting</h3>
    <p>
      We start by discussing the overall direction of your portfolio site—your current position,
      the images you want to highlight, the categories you need, and the visual tone of the site.
      Together, we decide on the most suitable structure and layout.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Sending Images & Text</h3>
    <p>
      After the direction is set, you send me your photos, captions, credits, and any relevant text.
      If your material is already organized, we can use it as is; if not, we will arrange it together.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Development Starts</h3>
    <p>
      Once all materials are ready, I begin coding and designing the layout:
      the overview gallery, lightbox display, category structure, and any required text pages.
      This is where your custom portfolio site takes shape.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Test Link (Preview)</h3>
    <p>
      When the build is complete, I publish a temporary preview using GitHub Pages.
      You can check the site on your phone, tablet, and computer to confirm layout, image flow,
      and text accuracy.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Final Review & Approval</h3>
    <p>
      If you have any adjustments, I will update them.  
      Once the final version is ready, you confirm your approval.  
      This marks the completion of the production stage and leads to the payment step.
    </p>

    <h3>6. Payment</h3>
    <p>
      After reviewing the test link on your own devices and confirming that everything is correct,
      you provide your approval and proceed with the production support fee (€1200).
    </p>

    <h3>7. Domain Connection & Official Launch</h3>
    <p>
      After the payment is confirmed, I connect your site to your chosen domain  
      and officially publish it as your portfolio website.
    </p>

    <p>
      If any small issues appear a few days after launch—such as minor visual adjustments or image alignment—
      I will fix these <strong>free of charge</strong>.  
      This is normal for static sites across different devices.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="return-policy">
    <h2>Return Policy (Cancellations & Refunds)</h2>

    <p>
      This service is a “results-based” support project offered only to trusted friends.  
      You confirm the completed website through a test link first, and only then proceed with the payment.
    </p>

    <h3>Cancellations</h3>
    <p>
      You may cancel at any stage if the project becomes difficult to continue  
      or if the direction changes.  
      In that case, please inform me as early as possible so we can align on the current progress.
    </p>

    <h3>Refunds After Approval</h3>
    <p>
      Once you have reviewed the test link and given your “approval,”  
      the production is considered complete.  
      Refunds after approval cannot be issued,  
      <strong>unless there is a critical, non-fixable coding error caused by me.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      Minor issues that may appear a few days after launch  
      (such as small layout adjustments or image alignment)  
      will be corrected <strong>free of charge</strong>,  
      as these are common with static sites across different devices.
    </p>

    <h3>External Factors</h3>
    <p>
      Changes caused by external factors — such as iOS updates, browser updates,  
      GitHub behavior changes, or device-specific differences —  
      <strong>are not eligible for refunds</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      When such external issues occur, I will check and help where possible,  
      but the work may involve additional fees depending on the amount of adjustment required.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="faq">
    <h2>FAQ</h2>
        <h3>Can another designer maintain or update the code?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes. The website belongs to you, so you are free to work with any designer you choose.
    </p>
    <h3>Q. After delivery, can someone else modify the code?</h3>
    <p>
      A. Yes, that is possible. However, if a third party rewrites or edits the code, the structure may no longer match the system I originally prepared. In such cases, even during the support period, it may become difficult—or sometimes impossible— for me to continue updates under the same conditions. If you're unsure, please feel free to consult me before any changes are made.
    </p>
    <p class="note-warning">In this context, “maintaining or updating the code” refers only to adding or replacing images, or making small text or caption edits.
    It does not include creating new pages, adding new features, or making major structural changes to the site.</p>

     <h3>Q. How many people are included in the “small group”?</h3>
    <p>A. At the moment, I’m planning for around 10 people. This number may increase or decrease depending on my schedule and workload. Thank you for your understanding.</p>

    <div class="faq-hidden">


    <h3>Is this fully custom?</h3>
    <p>This is essentially a semi-custom website. However, the final result is very close to the quality of a fully custom build.</p>

    <h3>What is the difference between full custom and semi-custom?</h3>
    <p>
      Typical semi-custom sites rely on existing templates or CMS platforms (Wix, WordPress, etc.) where only colors or basic layout settings are adjusted.
      My approach does not use templates. Layout, image structure, spacing, and presentation are all designed from scratch — making it closer to “full custom.”
    </p>

    <h3>Why not make it fully custom?</h3>
    <p>
      Artist portfolios do not require complex CMS systems or plugins — in fact, these often make sites heavier and more fragile.
      By building only what is necessary from scratch, the result is a lightweight, stable, long-term portfolio that is less prone to breakage.
    </p>

    <h3>Why is it called a “production assistance fee” instead of a “production fee”?</h3>
    <p>
      This service is designed to reduce unnecessary dependency between you and me in the long-term operation of your site.  
      Therefore, all code files and the GitHub account are <strong>fully owned by you</strong> from the beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are responsible for the artistic direction of your website,  
      while I provide the proposals and technical support needed to realize that vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      In other words, the website is not something “I make for you,” but  
      <strong>a collaborative creation between you and me</strong>.  
      For that reason, the cost is defined as a “production assistance fee,” not a standard production fee.
    </p>

    <h3>Who owns the website?</h3>
    <p>You do. Both the GitHub account and the code are under your name.</p>


    <h3>Is the 2-year renewal mandatory? And when is it?</h3>
    <p>
      No, renewal is optional. Even without renewal, your website remains online.  
      I will notify you one month before your support period ends.
    </p>


    <h3>What is included in the free updates?</h3>
    <p>Up to two small updates per week (image additions, replacements, caption fixes, etc.).</p>

    <h3>Is it possible that Natsuki stops offering this service in the future?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes, it is possible.  
      My main profession is makeup artistry, and there may be a time when I become too busy to continue.  
      If I decide to discontinue the service, I will notify you at least <strong>6 months in advance</strong>.
    </p>

    <h3>Then, is there any chance you will stop the service immediately after delivering my site?</h3>
    <p>
      No, there is no such risk.  
      I will <strong>always fulfill the first 2 years of support</strong> after delivery.  
      This is a core part of the service, and unless I face a major unforeseen circumstance (accident, serious illness, etc.), I will not abandon it.  
      You can use the initial 2-year support with full confidence.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your website lives in your own GitHub account and is entirely your property.  
      You may continue using it as is, or transfer it to another designer if needed.
    </p>

    <h3>What if I’ve never used GitHub?</h3>
    <p>
      No problem.  
      We will go through the necessary steps together when creating your account.  
      I will handle all the complex parts and publishing setup.  
      You do not need to touch any code.
    </p>

    <h3>How do I send new photos or updates?</h3>
    <p>
      Just send your images, captions, and credits via DM or email.  
      This is included in the “2 updates per week” support.
    </p>

    <h3>How many images can I upload?</h3>
    <p>
      There is no technical limit.  
      However, too many images can dilute the artistic direction. We will decide the ideal balance together.
    </p>

    <h3>What if I want to change the structure after the site is finished?</h3>
    <p>
      Small adjustments are possible.  
      Larger structural changes (new categories, major layout redesigns) will be discussed as new work.
    </p>

    <h3>Can you create a second semi-custom site for me?</h3>
    <p>
      It may be possible depending on my schedule.  
      Please contact me first.
    </p>

    <h3>Are the usage rights for my photos okay?</h3>
    <p>
      I assume the client has permission to use the photos.  
      Responsibility for copyright lies with the client (you), not the designer.
    </p>

    <h3>Is the site optimized for SEO?</h3>
    <p>
      Advanced SEO is not necessary for artist portfolios, but  
      the essential metadata and structure are properly set up.  
      This website is not meant to “rank widely,” but to  
      <strong>reach the specific people you want to show your work to.</strong>
    </p>

    <h3>Q. Is there a possibility that the service content or structure may change in the future?</h3> 
    <p>
      A. Yes. To maintain and improve the quality of support, the service contents, policies, and applicable fees may be reviewed and adjusted. In such cases, any changes will be explained in advance to clients who are currently using the service, and will only be applied after receiving their understanding and approval.

    <h2>Final Message</h2>

    <p>
      Thank you so much for reading through everything.  
      What started simply as a personal need — building my own portfolio —  
      eventually made me realize that many artists around me were struggling  
      with the exact same problems.
    </p>

    <p>
      I wanted to create something small, personal, and meaningful:  
      a way to support trusted friends, and to help each of us move forward  
      in our creative careers with clarity and confidence.
    </p>

    <p>
      That intention is what shaped this project —  
      the small, friend-based support system I call  
      <strong>“Artists on Website.”</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      This is not about business expansion or building a large client list.  
      It’s simply a clear and transparent structure that I share  
      with the artists I genuinely care about.
    </p>

    <p>
      If this project becomes even a small push forward in your creative journey,  
      it would mean the world to me.

  <!-- INTRO -->
  <section id="intro-fr">
    <h2>Introduction</h2> 
    <p>
      Je suis maquilleuse freelance. Après avoir essayé des services comme Wix, Format et Cargo, ainsi que le modèle classique des « agences de création de sites web », je n’ai jamais trouvé un système réellement adapté aux besoins d’un portfolio d’artiste individuel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pour les maquilleurs et coiffeurs, la plupart des services web sont tout simplement trop lourds — trop chers, trop complexes, ou trop dépendants de designers externes et de sociétés de production.
    </p> 
    <p>
      Après avoir testé plusieurs plateformes sans jamais être satisfaite, j’ai finalement décidé d’apprendre le code et de construire mon propre site à partir de zéro. J’ai commencé au moment idéal : au moment où les outils d’IA évoluaient très rapidement. Cela a rendu possible — même pour quelqu’un comme moi, avec seulement des compétences débutantes en programmation — la création d’un portfolio propre, stable et de qualité agence.
    </p> 
    <p>
      En termes de transparence des coûts, d’ergonomie et de stabilité à long terme, je pense désormais que cette approche offre plus de contrôle et de clarté que ce que proposent beaucoup de webdesigners professionnels.
    </p> 
    <p>
      Grâce à une combinaison de code écrit à la main, d’outils modernes et d’IA, je peux aujourd’hui proposer un système simple, transparent et facile à maintenir — non seulement pour moi, mais aussi pour les artistes autour de moi. Pour les créatifs indépendants qui travaillent chaque jour dans une ville compétitive comme Paris, ceci est devenu l’une des options les plus pratiques et efficaces pour conserver un portfolio solide et fiable.

    <h2>À propos de ce service</h2>

    <p>
      Il ne s’agit pas d’une activité commerciale de création de sites web.<br>
      C’est un service d’accompagnement restreint, sur invitation, destiné à un petit groupe d’amis en qui j’ai totalement confiance.
    </p>

    <p>
      Je ne produis pas de sites en série.<br>
      Garder le groupe petit me permet de maintenir la qualité, l’attention et une communication appropriée.<br>
      Même si la structure est « semi-personnalisée », le résultat final se rapproche fortement d’un site entièrement sur-mesure — quelque chose qui ne ressemble à aucun autre modèle.
    </p>

    <p>
      Je ne suis pas une agence web.<br>
      Je contribue seulement à réduire les coûts et les dépendances inutiles tout en fournissant un portfolio propre, stable et de niveau agence, qui exprime fidèlement votre identité artistique.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mon propre portfolio
      <a href="https://natsukioneyama.com" target="_blank">natsukioneyama.com</a>
      est entièrement réalisé à la main, en utilisant du code personnalisé et GitHub.<br>
      Le système que je propose ici est exactement celui que j’utilise pour mon travail professionnel, et il a prouvé sa fiabilité dans des conditions réelles.

      <li>Des artistes ayant réellement besoin d’un portfolio professionnel.</li>

  <section id="github-fr">
    <h2>À propos de GitHub – Fonctionnement & Propriété du site</h2>

    <p>
      GitHub est une plateforme appartenant à Microsoft et l’un des plus grands services d’hébergement de code au monde.
      C’est là que des millions de développeurs et designers stockent, partagent et publient leurs projets.
      En termes de fiabilité, de rapidité et de stabilité, c’est aujourd’hui l’un des meilleurs environnements gratuits d’hébergement.
    </p>

    <h3>Qu’est-ce que l’« hébergement » ?</h3>
    <p>
      Héberger un site signifie simplement placer vos fichiers (HTML / CSS / JavaScript, etc.)
      sur un serveur en ligne pour que tout le monde puisse y accéder.<br>
      Beaucoup imaginent des serveurs payants ou des abonnements mensuels,<br>
      mais GitHub Pages offre l’hébergement <strong>entièrement gratuitement</strong>.<br>
      La création d’un compte est gratuite également.
    </p>

    <h3>Pourquoi de nombreux designers professionnels utilisent GitHub aujourd’hui</h3>
    <p>
      Ces dernières années, de plus en plus de webdesigners professionnels ont commencé
      à créer des sites clients avec GitHub Pages.<br>
      La raison est simple : cela répond à toutes les conditions essentielles :
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Rapide</li>
      <li>Stable</li>
      <li>Sécurisé</li>
      <li>Aucun coût de fonctionnement</li>
      <li>Difficile à casser</li>
      <li>Aucune dépendance (le propriétaire, c’est toujours vous)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>En quoi cela diffère-t-il des studios et freelances classiques ?</h3>
    <p>
      Même si un designer utilise GitHub, la plupart des studios ou freelances facturent encore
      des « frais de maintenance » ou « frais de gestion » tous les mois ou chaque année.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mais dans mon système, le site est construit directement
      dans <strong>votre propre compte GitHub</strong>, et le code est
      <strong>100 % votre propriété</strong>.<br>
      Tant que votre compte GitHub existe, votre site reste votre actif.
    </p>

    <h3>Pourquoi cette méthode est idéale pour les portfolios d’artistes</h3>
    <p>
      Les portfolios n’ont pas besoin de fonctionnalités lourdes ni de gros serveurs.<br>
      En réalité, le meilleur portfolio est celui qui est :
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Léger</li>
      <li>Stable et difficile à casser</li>
      <li>Rapide</li>
      <li>Facile à maintenir</li>
      <li>Indépendant de tout designer ou société</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Cette structure permet de créer
      un portfolio durable, de niveau agence,
      avec un coût minimal et un contrôle maximal pour l’artiste.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="concept-fr">
    <h2>Concept principal</h2>

    <p>
      Les sites que je crée reposent sur une structure simple et très visuelle.<br>
      Dans le métier du maquillage et de la coiffure, tout dépend de la manière dont le travail est montré.<br>
      C’est pourquoi le design retire toute décoration inutile et se concentre sur la clarté —
      permettant à votre univers, votre technique et votre esthétique de s’exprimer simplement
      grâce au défilement.
    </p>

    <p>
      Beaucoup de mes amis artistes sont individualistes et ambitieux.
      Ils ne se contentent pas de rester où ils sont — ils continuent de développer leur expression personnelle,
      que ce soit à travers le travail client, des projets personnels ou l’exploration créative quotidienne.<br>
      Même si vous avez déjà un portfolio destiné aux clients ou une sélection d’agence,
      il existe très peu d’endroits où vous pouvez présenter
      les images que vous souhaitez vraiment montrer, exactement comme vous souhaitez les montrer,
      y compris les travaux personnels et expérimentaux qui forment votre véritable base.
    </p>

    <p>
      Je pense que c’est là la véritable fonction d’un portfolio personnel d’artiste :
      un lieu où votre univers peut être montré tel qu’il est — sans compromis,
      sans restrictions inutiles, et dans un format qui accompagne votre rythme
      et votre direction à long terme.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ce que je propose est une manière pratique et économique d’exprimer votre travail
      exactement comme vous l’imaginez :
      clair, simple, visuellement fort, et structuré pour les parcours créatifs réels.

    <h2>Tarifs – Frais d’accompagnement à la production (1200€)</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>Frais d’accompagnement : 1200€ (inclut la création + les 2 premières années de support)</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      Les 1200€ couvrent la création initiale de votre portfolio
      ainsi que 2 ans de support opérationnel.<br>
      Rapporté au mois, cela correspond à environ <strong>50€ / mois</strong>.<br>
      C’est un système durable et à faible maintenance, adapté aux artistes professionnels.
    </p>

    <p>En plus :</p>
    <p>・ L’utilisation de GitHub Pages signifie qu’il n’y a aucun coût d’hébergement.</p>
    <p>・ Le seul coût récurrent est la redevance annuelle de votre domaine personnalisé.</p>
    <p>・ Après 2 ans, un renouvellement de support optionnel est disponible (100€ / 2 ans).</p>

    <div class="summary-outer">
      <div class="summary-inner">
        <p class="summary-label">
          En résumé, vous pouvez faire fonctionner votre propre site personnalisé à long terme, <br>
          pour seulement 1200€ + le coût de votre domaine.
        </p>
        <p class="summary-txt">
          Renouvellement optionnel du support : 100 € tous les 2 ans.

      </div>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section id="market-facts-fr">
    <h2>Le marché – Coût réel d’un site professionnel</h2>

    <p>
      À première vue, 1200€ peuvent sembler élevés.<br>
      Mais lorsqu’on regarde les tarifs réels du marché pour un portfolio,
      ce prix se situe en réalité dans la fourchette basse.
    </p>

    <h3>Exemple de répartition des coûts chez un webdesigner freelance</h3>
    <p>
      Pour un portfolio simple — par exemple une page overview et une galerie lightbox —,
      les prix habituels en Europe ressemblent à ceci :
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Consultation & structure :</strong> 200–400€<br>
        (plan du site, décision de la structure)
      </li>
      <li><strong>Design (page d’accueil + overview + page infos) :</strong> 400–700€</li>
      <li><strong>Coding (HTML / CSS / JavaScript, responsive) :</strong> 400–800€</li>
      <li><strong>Galerie + lightbox :</strong> 300–500€</li>
      <li><strong>Mise en ligne, domaine, vérifications finales :</strong> 150–300€</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Au total, on atteint facilement
      <strong>1500–2700€</strong>, selon le designer.
    </p>

    <h3>Frais mensuels de « maintenance »</h3>
    <p>
      Beaucoup d’agences et freelances facturent également des frais mensuels ou annuels pour :
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Gestion serveur / domaine</li>
      <li>Mises à jour de sécurité</li>
      <li>Petites modifications</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Ces plans coûtent généralement
      <strong>30–100€ par mois</strong>, parfois plus.
    </p>

    <p>
      En réalité, les coûts de création et de maintenance s’accumulent rapidement —
      surtout pour les artistes, dont le portfolio fait partie de leur identité professionnelle.
    </p>

    <p>
      C’est pourquoi les 1200€ (avec deux ans de support inclus)
      sont conçus comme une option réaliste et prévisible,
      sans frais cachés.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="compare-fr">
    <h2>Autres options – Services de type Wix / Format / Cargo</h2>

    <h3>À propos des « website builders »</h3>
    <p>
      Ces outils permettent de créer un site en choisissant un modèle prédéfini.
      Ils sont pratiques et rapides, mais pour un portfolio axé sur l’image,
      ils présentent plusieurs limites :
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Liberté de design limitée par le modèle</li>
      <li>Difficile de personnaliser la présentation des images</li>
      <li>Abonnements permanents (200–300€ par an)</li>
      <li>Le design peut changer quand la plateforme met à jour ses modèles</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Dans un métier où la manière de présenter le travail est essentielle,
      ces limites peuvent réellement affecter l’impact de votre portfolio.
    </p>

    <h3>Pourquoi mon système GitHub est différent</h3>
    <p>
      Tout repose sur une priorité :<br>
      <strong>vos images doivent être montrées dans leur meilleur aspect.</strong><br>
      Grâce à un code léger et GitHub Pages (gratuit), le site est rapide, stable
      et totalement indépendant.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Aucun coût de fonctionnement</strong> (pas d’hébergement, pas de contrat)</li>
      <li><strong>Vous êtes le propriétaire</strong> — le code vous appartient</li>
      <li><strong>Rapide et léger</strong> — idéal pour les portfolios photo</li>
      <li><strong>Sans fonctions inutiles</strong> — uniquement ce qui sert votre travail</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Pour un portfolio d’artiste, un site statique léger est souvent la solution la plus forte
      et la moins stressante — financièrement et créativement.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="aftercare-fr">
    <h2>Après-vente – Les deux premières années</h2>

    <p>
      Durant les deux premières années, vous pouvez demander jusqu’à deux petites mises à jour par semaine
      (ajout de photos, remplacements, corrections de texte).  
      Ces mises à jour sont incluses sans frais supplémentaires.
    </p>

    <p>
      Les modifications structurelles importantes — nouvelles catégories, redesign, etc. —
      seront traitées comme de nouvelles demandes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Tous les problèmes présents au moment de la livraison
      (bugs d’affichage, liens cassés, erreurs de mise en page)
      sont entièrement sous ma responsabilité et seront corrigés gratuitement.
    </p>

    <p>
      Cependant, les problèmes causés par des <strong>facteurs externes</strong> —
      mises à jour iOS, mises à jour navigateurs, nouveaux appareils, changements GitHub —
      ne relèvent pas de la responsabilité initiale du créateur.
    </p>

    <p>
      Si de tels problèmes apparaissent, j’examinerai la situation et aiderai autant que possible.
      Selon la charge de travail, des frais additionnels peuvent s’appliquer.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ce service est destiné uniquement à des amis en qui j’ai confiance et que je souhaite soutenir sur le long terme.
      Je fais au mieux pour garder une structure équitable pour les deux parties.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="renewal-fr">
    <h2>Renouvellement du support – Optionnel</h2>

    <p>
      Après les deux premières années, votre site reste en ligne tel quel.<br>
      Si vous souhaitez que je continue d’assurer les petites mises à jour et la maintenance,
      vous pouvez choisir l’option suivante :
    </p>

    <p><strong>Renouvellement du support : 100 € / 2 ans</strong></p>

    <p>
      Si un jour je ne peux plus assurer le support,
      je vous en informerai au moins six mois avant la fin de votre période en cours.

  <section id="payment-flow-fr">
    <h2>Processus de production & paiement</h2>

    <p>
      Le projet suit un processus simple et clair.<br>
      De la première discussion à la mise en ligne finale, les étapes sont les suivantes :
    </p>

    <h3>1. Entretien de direction artistique</h3>
    <p>
      Nous discutons d’abord de l’orientation générale de votre portfolio — votre position actuelle,
      les images à mettre en avant, les catégories nécessaires et le ton visuel.<br>
      Ensemble, nous définissons la structure la plus adaptée.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Envoi des images & textes</h3>
    <p>
      Après avoir défini la direction, vous m’envoyez vos photos, légendes, crédits,
      et tout texte pertinent.<br>
      Si votre matériel est déjà organisé, nous l’utiliserons tel quel ; sinon, nous l’organiserons ensemble.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Développement</h3>
    <p>
      Une fois tous les éléments prêts, je commence à coder et à concevoir la mise en page :
      galerie overview, lightbox, structure des catégories, pages nécessaires.<br>
      C’est là que votre portfolio sur-mesure prend forme.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Lien de test (aperçu)</h3>
    <p>
      Une fois la construction terminée, je publie un aperçu temporaire via GitHub Pages.<br>
      Vous pouvez vérifier le site sur téléphone, tablette et ordinateur pour confirmer
      le rendu des images, la mise en page et les textes.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Révision finale & validation</h3>
    <p>
      Si vous souhaitez des ajustements, je les effectue.<br>
      Une fois la version finale prête, vous donnez votre validation.<br>
      Cela marque la fin de la production et mène à l’étape du paiement.
    </p>

    <h3>6. Paiement</h3>
    <p>
      Après avoir vérifié le lien de test sur vos appareils
      et confirmé que tout est correct,
      vous procédez au paiement du forfait de support à la production (1200€).
    </p>

    <h3>7. Connexion du domaine & lancement officiel</h3>
    <p>
      Après confirmation du paiement, je connecte votre domaine
      et publie officiellement votre site en ligne.
    </p>

    <p>
      Si de petites imperfections apparaissent après quelques jours —
      légers ajustements visuels ou alignements d’images —,
      je les corrigerai <strong>gratuitement</strong>.<br>
      C’est normal pour les sites statiques selon les appareils.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="return-policy-fr">
    <h2>Conditions d’annulation & de remboursement</h2>

    <p>
      Ce service est un accompagnement basé sur le résultat, réservé à des amis de confiance.<br>
      Vous validez d’abord le site via un lien de test, puis seulement après vous procédez au paiement.
    </p>

    <h3>Annulations</h3>
    <p>
      Vous pouvez annuler à tout moment si la poursuite du projet devient difficile
      ou si la direction change.<br>
      Dans ce cas, merci de me prévenir dès que possible afin d’évaluer l’avancement.
    </p>

    <h3>Remboursements après validation</h3>
    <p>
      Une fois que vous avez validé le lien de test,
      la production est considérée comme terminée.<br>
      Aucun remboursement n’est possible,
      <strong>sauf en cas d’erreur critique et non réparable de ma part.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      Les petites imperfections qui peuvent apparaître quelques jours après la mise en ligne
      (ajustements mineurs, alignement d’images)
      seront corrigées <strong>gratuitement</strong>,
      car elles sont courantes sur les sites statiques.
    </p>

    <h3>Facteurs externes</h3>
    <p>
      Les problèmes causés par des facteurs externes — mises à jour iOS, navigateurs,
      changements GitHub, particularités d’appareils —
      <strong>ne sont pas éligibles au remboursement</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      En cas de problème externe, j’aiderai autant que possible,
      mais selon la charge de travail nécessaire, des frais peuvent s’appliquer.

     <h3>Un autre designer peut-il modifier ou maintenir le code ?</h3>
    <p>
      Oui. Le site vous appartient, donc vous êtes libre de collaborer avec qui vous voulez.
    </p>
     <h3>Après la livraison, puis-je demander à quelqu’un d’autre de modifier le code ?</h3>
    <p>
      R. Oui, c’est possible. Toutefois, si un tiers réécrit ou modifie le code, la structure risque de ne plus correspondre à celle que j’ai mise en place. Dans ce cas, même pendant la période de support, il peut devenir difficile — voire impossible — pour moi de poursuivre les mises à jour dans les mêmes conditions. En cas de doute, n’hésitez pas à me consulter avant toute modification.
    </p>
    <p class="note-warning">Dans ce contexte, « maintenir ou mettre à jour le code » signifie uniquement ajouter ou remplacer des images, ou effectuer de petites modifications de texte ou de légendes.
    Cela n’inclut pas la création de nouvelles pages, l’ajout de nouvelles fonctionnalités, ni les modifications structurelles importantes du site.</p>

    <h3>Q. Combien de personnes sont incluses dans le « petit groupe » ?</h3>
    <p>
      A. Pour le moment, j’envisage environ dix personnes. Ce nombre peut augmenter ou diminuer selon ma disponibilité et ma charge de travail. Merci de votre compréhension.
    </p>

     <div class="faq-hidden">

    <h3>Est-ce entièrement sur-mesure ?</h3>
    <p>
      Il s’agit d’un site semi-personnalisé, mais le résultat final est très proche d’un site entièrement sur-mesure.
    </p>

    <h3>Quelle est la différence entre sur-mesure et semi-personnalisé ?</h3>
    <p>
      Les sites semi-personnalisés classiques reposent sur des modèles existants (Wix, WordPress, etc.)
      où seules quelques options sont ajustées.<br>
      Mon approche n’utilise aucun modèle. Le design, la structure des images, les espacements et la présentation sont créés à partir de zéro — ce qui rapproche le résultat d’un « vrai sur-mesure ».
    </p>

    <h3>Pourquoi ne pas faire du 100 % sur-mesure ?</h3>
    <p>
      Les portfolios d’artistes n’ont pas besoin de systèmes complexes ou de plugins lourds — souvent sources de lenteur ou de bugs.<br>
      En ne construisant que ce qui est nécessaire, on obtient un site léger, stable et durable.
    </p>

    <h3>Pourquoi parler de « frais d’accompagnement » et non de « frais de production » ?</h3>
    <p>
      Ce service est conçu pour réduire la dépendance à long terme entre vous et moi.<br>
      C’est pourquoi tous les fichiers et le compte GitHub sont <strong>votre propriété</strong> dès le début.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vous êtes responsable de la direction artistique du site,
      tandis que je fournis les propositions et le support technique nécessaires.
    </p>
    <p>
      Autrement dit, ce site n’est pas quelque chose que je « fais pour vous »,
      mais <strong>une création collaborative entre vous et moi</strong>.<br>
      C’est pour cela que le coût est défini comme « accompagnement à la production ».
    </p>

    <h3>Qui possède le site ?</h3>
    <p>
      Vous. Le compte GitHub et le code sont à votre nom.
    </p>

    <h3>Le renouvellement est-il obligatoire ?</h3>
    <p>
      Non. Le renouvellement est optionnel.<br>
      Même sans renouvellement, votre site reste en ligne.<br>
      Je vous préviendrai un mois avant la fin de votre période de support.
    </p>

    <h3>Que comprennent les mises à jour gratuites ?</h3>
    <p>
      Jusqu’à deux petites mises à jour par semaine (ajout d’images, remplacements, corrections).
    </p>

    <h3>Est-il possible que Natsuki arrête ce service à l’avenir ?</h3>
    <p>
      Oui, c’est possible.<br>
      Mon activité principale est le maquillage, et il se peut qu’un jour je sois trop occupée.<br>
      Si je dois arrêter le service, je vous préviendrai au moins <strong>6 mois à l’avance</strong>.
    </p>

    <h3>Est-il possible que vous arrêtiez juste après avoir livré mon site ?</h3>
    <p>
      Non.<br>
      Je respecte toujours les deux premières années de support.<br>
      Sauf en cas de circonstances exceptionnelles (accident, maladie grave, etc.),
      je n’abandonnerai jamais le service.<br>
      Vous pouvez être entièrement serein quant au support initial.
    </p>

    <p>
      Votre site appartient entièrement à votre compte GitHub.
      Vous pouvez continuer à l’utiliser tel quel ou travailler avec un autre designer.
    </p>
  
    <h3>Et si je n’ai jamais utilisé GitHub ?</h3>
    <p>
      Aucun problème.<br>
      Nous ferons ensemble les étapes nécessaires pour créer votre compte.<br>
      Je m’occuperai des parties techniques et de la mise en ligne.<br>
      Vous n’aurez rien à manipuler.
    </p>

    <h3>Comment envoyer de nouvelles photos ?</h3>
    <p>
      Envoyez-les simplement par DM ou email.<br>
      Cela fait partie des « 2 mises à jour par semaine ».
    </p>

    <h3>Combien d’images puis-je télécharger ?</h3>
    <p>
      Il n’y a pas de limite technique.<br>
      Cependant, un trop grand nombre d’images peut affaiblir la direction artistique.<br>
      Nous trouverons ensemble le bon équilibre.
    </p>

    <h3>Et si je veux changer la structure après la livraison ?</h3>
    <p>
      De petits ajustements sont possibles.<br>
      Les changements structurels plus importants seront traités comme de nouveaux travaux.
    </p>

    <h3>Pouvez-vous créer un deuxième site semi-personnalisé ?</h3>
    <p>
      C’est possible selon mon emploi du temps.<br>
      Contactez-moi d’abord.
    </p>

    <h3>Les droits d’utilisation de mes photos sont-ils en règle ?</h3>
    <p>
      Je pars du principe que le client a les droits nécessaires sur les images.<br>
      La responsabilité incombe au client.
    </p>

    <h3>Le site est-il optimisé pour le SEO ?</h3>
    <p>
      Un SEO avancé n’est pas nécessaire pour un portfolio artistique,
      mais les éléments essentiels sont correctement configurés.<br>
      L’objectif n’est pas de « toucher tout le monde »,
      mais de <strong>toucher les personnes que vous souhaitez réellement atteindre</strong>.
    </p>

    <h3>Le service peut-il évoluer dans le futur ?</h3> 
    <p>
      Oui. Afin de maintenir la qualité du support, les contenus, politiques et tarifs peuvent être ajustés.<br>
      Les changements seront expliqués aux clients concernés et appliqués uniquement après accord.

    <h2>Message final</h2>

    <p>
      Merci d’avoir tout lu.<br>
      Ce qui a commencé comme un besoin personnel — créer mon propre portfolio —
      m’a fait réaliser que beaucoup d’artistes autour de moi rencontraient les mêmes problèmes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Je voulais créer quelque chose de petit, personnel et significatif :
      un moyen de soutenir des amis de confiance et d’aider chacun à avancer
      dans sa carrière créative avec clarté et confiance.
    </p>

     <p>
      C’est cette intention qui a donné naissance à « <strong>Artists on Website</strong> ».
     </p>

     <p>
     Ce n’est pas un business destiné à agrandir une liste de clients.<br>
     C’est un partenariat simple et transparent que je souhaite partager avec les artistes de mon entourage.
     </p>

    <p>
      Si ce projet peut apporter ne serait-ce qu’un petit élan dans votre parcours créatif,
      ce serait une immense joie pour moi.

    <h2>イントロダクション</h2> 
    <p>
      私はフリーランスのメイクアップアーティストです。  
      Wix、Format、Cargo といったサービスや、いわゆる「ウェブ制作会社」のモデルも試してきましたが、  
      個人アーティストのポートフォリオのニーズに本当にフィットする仕組みは見つかりませんでした。
    </p>
    <p>
      特にヘアメイクのような職種にとっては、多くのウェブサービスが「やりすぎ」なのです。  
      価格が高すぎたり、管理が複雑すぎたり、外部のデザイナーや制作会社への依存が大きすぎたりします。
    </p> 
    <p>
      いくつものプラットフォームを試しても満足できなかったため、  
      最終的に私は自分でコードを学び、ゼロから自分のサイトを作ることにしました。  
      そのタイミングは、ちょうどAIツールが急速に進化していた時期でもありました。  
      そのおかげで、プログラミング初心者レベルの私でも、  
      クリーンで安定した「エージェンシークオリティ」のポートフォリオサイトを作ることが可能になりました。
    </p> 
    <p>
      コストの透明性、使いやすさ、長期的な安定性という点で、  
      今ではこのアプローチは、多くのプロのウェブデザイナーが提供するもの以上に、  
      コントロールと見通しの良さを与えてくれると感じています。
    </p> 
    <p>
      手書きのコード、現代的なツール、そしてAIを組み合わせることで、  
      今では自分自身だけでなく、周りのアーティストたちにも共有できる、  
      シンプルで透明性があり、メンテナンスも簡単な仕組みを提供できるようになりました。  
      パリのような競争の激しい都市で日々活動している独立系クリエイターにとって、  
      これは強く、信頼できるポートフォリオを維持するための、  
      とても実用的で効率的な選択肢のひとつになっていると思います。

  <section id="github-ja">
    <h2>GitHub について – 仕組みと「サイトの所有者」</h2>

    <p>
      GitHub は Microsoft 傘下のプラットフォームで、世界最大級のコードホスティングサービスの一つです。  
      何百万人もの開発者やデザイナーが、ここでプロジェクトを保存・共有・公開しています。  
      信頼性、速度、安定性という点で、現在利用できる「無料ホスティング環境」の中でも  
      非常に強力な選択肢の一つです。
    </p>

    <h3>「ホスティング」とは？</h3>
    <p>
      ホスティングとは、サイトのファイル（HTML / CSS / JavaScript など）を  
      オンライン上のサーバーに置き、誰もがブラウザからアクセスできる状態にすることです。<br>
      一般的には「有料サーバー契約」や「月額料金」をイメージする方が多いですが、  
      GitHub Pages を使えば、<strong>ホスティングは完全に無料</strong>です。<br>
      アカウントの作成も無料です。
    </p>

    <h3>なぜ今、多くのプロのデザイナーが GitHub を使うのか</h3>
    <p>
      ここ数年、多くのプロのウェブデザイナーが  
      クライアントサイトの公開に GitHub Pages を使うようになってきました。<br>
      理由はとてもシンプルで、ポートフォリオに必要な条件をすべて満たしているからです。
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>表示が速い</li>
      <li>安定している</li>
      <li>セキュリティ面で安心</li>
      <li>ランニングコストがかからない</li>
      <li>ちょっとした操作では壊れにくい</li>
      <li>依存関係がない（所有者は常に「自分」）</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>制作会社や一般的なフリーランスとの違い</h3>
    <p>
      デザイナーが GitHub を使っていたとしても、  
      多くの制作会社やフリーランスは「保守費」や「管理費」といった名目で  
      月額または年額の料金を請求し続けます。
    </p>

    <p>
      一方この仕組みでは、サイトは最初から  
      <strong>あなた自身の GitHub アカウントの中</strong>に構築され、  
      コードも含めて <strong>100％あなたの所有物</strong>になります。<br>
      あなたの GitHub アカウントが存在する限り、そのサイトはあなたの資産として残り続けます。
    </p>

    <h3>なぜアーティストのポートフォリオに向いているのか</h3>
    <p>
      ポートフォリオサイトに「重い機能」や「大規模なサーバー」は基本的に必要ありません。<br>
      実際に最も理想的なポートフォリオとは、次のようなものだと考えています。
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>軽い（表示が速い）</li>
      <li>壊れにくく、安定している</li>
      <li>管理が簡単</li>
      <li>特定のデザイナーや会社に依存しない</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      この構造を採用することで、  
      コストを最低限に抑えつつ、アーティスト側のコントロールを最大化したまま、  
      長く使える「エージェンシーレベル」のポートフォリオサイトを作ることができます。
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="concept-ja">
    <h2>コアコンセプト</h2>

    <p>
      私が作るポートフォリオサイトは、シンプルで視覚的な構造をベースにしています。<br>
      ヘアメイクという職業では、とにかく「作品の見せ方」がすべてだと思っています。<br>
      そのため、不要な装飾はできるだけ排除し、  
      スクロールしていくだけで、あなたの世界観・技術・美意識が自然と伝わる構成を目指しています。
    </p>

    <p>
      私の周りのアーティスト仲間は、とても個性的で、野心的な人が多いです。  
      現状にとどまることに満足せず、クライアントワークや個人制作、日々の実験的な表現を通して、  
      自分の世界を常に更新し続けています。<br>
      すでにクライアント向けのポートフォリオや、エージェンシーのブックを持っている場合でも、  
      「自分が本当に見せたいイメージ」を、「自分の望む見せ方」でまとめられる場所は、  
      実はほとんど存在していません。特に、自分のベースとなる個人的・実験的な作品に関してはなおさらです。
    </p>

    <p>
      私は、そうした「自分の本当の土台となる作品」を見せる場所こそ、  
      パーソナルなアーティストポートフォリオの本来の役割だと考えています。<br>
      妥協や不必要な制限に縛られず、  
      自分のペースと長期的な方向性を支えてくれるフォーマットであるべきだと思います。
    </p>

    <p>
      私の提供するものは、そういった考えに基づいた、  
      できるだけ実用的でコスト効率の良い「表現の器」です。<br>
      クリーンでシンプル、視覚的に強く、  
      実際のクリエイティブキャリアの現場で使える構造を意識しています。
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="pricing-ja">
    <h2>料金 – 制作サポート費（1200€）</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>制作サポート費：1200€（サイト制作＋最初の2年間のサポートを含む）</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      1200€ の中には、ポートフォリオサイトの初期制作と、2年間の運用サポートが含まれています。<br>
      月額換算すると、約 <strong>50€ / 月</strong> ほどのイメージです。<br>
      実際の現場で活動するプロアーティストが、安心して長く使える  
      「低メンテナンスなポートフォリオ」を想定しています。
    </p>

    <p>さらに、</p>
    <p>・ GitHub Pages を使うため、サーバーのホスティング費用はかかりません。</p>
    <p>・ 毎年かかるのは、ご自身の独自ドメインの年額料金のみです。</p>

          必要に応じて、2年ごと 100€ でサポート更新も選択できます。

  </section>

  <section id="market-facts-ja">
    <h2>相場の話 – 一般的なサイト制作費</h2>

    <p>
      一見すると、1200€ は高く感じるかもしれません。<br>
      ですが、実際のポートフォリオサイトの相場と比べてみると、  
      この金額はむしろ「低めのレンジ」に入ります。
    </p>

    <h3>フリーランスのウェブデザイナーに依頼した場合の目安</h3>
    <p>
      例えば、シンプルなヘアメイクのポートフォリオサイト（overview ページ＋ lightbox ギャラリー）を  
      ヨーロッパのフリーランスデザイナーに依頼した場合、ざっくりとした目安は次のようになります。
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>ヒアリング＆構成設計：</strong> 200–400€<br>
        （サイトマップ、ページ構成の決定など）
      </li>
      <li><strong>デザイン（トップ＋オーバービュー＋基本情報ページ）：</strong> 400–700€</li>
      <li><strong>コーディング（HTML / CSS / JavaScript、レスポンシブ対応）：</strong> 400–800€</li>
      <li><strong>ギャラリー＋ライトボックス実装：</strong> 300–500€</li>
      <li><strong>サーバー設定、ドメイン接続、最終チェック：</strong> 150–300€</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      合計すると、プロジェクトやデザイナーによって変動はありますが、  
      おおよそ <strong>1500–2700€</strong> 程度になることが多いです。
    </p>

    <h3>毎月・毎年かかる「保守費」</h3>
    <p>
      さらに、多くのデザイナーや制作会社は、以下のような名目で  
      月額または年額の「保守・管理費」を設定しています。
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>サーバー・ドメインの管理</li>
      <li>セキュリティアップデートやバックアップ</li>
      <li>小さいテキストや画像の変更</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      こうした保守プランは、  
      月額 <strong>30–100€</strong> 程度になることが一般的です。
    </p>

    <p>
      このように、サイト制作とその後の維持費を合計すると、  
      特にポートフォリオが「仕事道具」であるアーティストにとっては、  
      コストがどんどん積み上がってしまいます。
    </p>

    <p>
      だからこそ、2年分のサポート込みで 1200€ という一括費用は、  
      毎月のランニングコストを抱え続ける代わりに、  
      必要なものを最初からすべて含めておく、という現実的で分かりやすい選択肢になっています。
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="compare-ja">
    <h2>他の選択肢 – Wix / Format / Cargo など</h2>

    <h3>いわゆる「サイトビルダーサービス」について</h3>
    <p>
      Wix や Format、Cargo などのサービスは、用意されたテンプレートを選び、  
      画面上でパーツを組み立てていくタイプの「サイトビルダー」です。<br>
      手軽でスピーディですが、特にビジュアル中心のアーティストポートフォリオとして  
      長期的に使う場合、いくつかの限界があります。
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>デザインの自由度がテンプレートの構造に縛られる</li>
      <li>画像レイアウトや見せ方を細かくコントロールしづらい</li>
      <li>サブスクリプション料金がずっとかかる（年 200–300€ 程度が一般的）</li>
      <li>サービス側のテンプレート更新でレイアウトが変わることがある</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      「作品の見せ方」が直接評価につながるヘアメイクのような仕事では、  
      こうした制約がそのまま印象の差になってしまうことがあります。
    </p>

    <h3>私の GitHub ベースのやり方との違い</h3>
    <p>
      私のシステムは、ひとつの優先順位に集約されています。<br>
      <strong>「あなたの作品が、一番良い状態で見えること」。</strong><br>
      軽量なコードと GitHub Pages（無料）を組み合わせることで、  
      サイトを速く、安定していて、完全に独立した状態に保ちます。
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>ランニングコストなし</strong>（ホスティング費・保守契約なし）</li>
      <li><strong>所有者はあなた自身</strong> – リポジトリとコードはあなたのアカウントに紐づきます</li>
      <li><strong>軽くて高速</strong> – 画像の多いポートフォリオに向いています</li>
      <li><strong>不要な機能は付けない</strong> – 作品を見せるために必要な部分だけに絞ります</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      アーティストのポートフォリオにとっては、  
      軽量な静的サイトこそが、クリエイティブ面・金銭面の両方で  
      最もストレスの少ない選択肢になることが多いと感じています。

      このプロジェクトは、シンプルで分かりやすいステップで進みます。<br>
      最初のヒアリングから公開までの流れは、次のようになります。
    </p>

    <h3>1. 方向性のミーティング</h3>
    <p>
      まずは、ポートフォリオサイト全体の方向性について話し合います。  
      現在の活動状況、見せたい画像、必要なカテゴリ、サイトのトーンなどを整理し、  
      一緒に最適な構成とレイアウトを決めていきます。
    </p>

    <h3>2. 画像とテキストの受け取り</h3>
    <p>
      方向性が固まったら、写真、キャプション、クレジット、プロフィール文など、  
      必要な素材を送っていただきます。  
      すでに整理されている場合はそのまま使い、まだバラバラな場合は、一緒に整理していきます。
    </p>

    <h3>3. サイト制作（デザイン & コーディング）</h3>
    <p>
      素材が揃ったら、実際の制作に入ります。  
      Overview ギャラリーやライトボックス、カテゴリ構造、必要なテキストページなど、  
      あなた専用のポートフォリオサイトの形を作っていきます。
    </p>

    <h3>4. テストリンク（プレビュー）</h3>
    <p>
      制作が一通り完了したら、GitHub Pages を使ってテスト用のリンクを公開します。  
      スマホ・タブレット・パソコンなど、ご自身のデバイスで表示をチェックしてもらい、  
      画像の流れやレイアウト、テキストの内容を確認していただきます。
    </p>

    <h3>5. 最終調整 & 承認</h3>
    <p>
      修正したい点があれば、この段階で反映します。  
      最終版に問題がなくなったところで、サイトの内容に「OK」をいただきます。  
      ここまでで制作工程が完了し、次がお支払いのステップになります。
    </p>

    <h3>6. お支払い</h3>
    <p>
      テストリンクを実際にご自身の環境で確認し、  
      「この内容で公開して大丈夫」となったタイミングで、  
      制作サポート費（1200€）のお支払いをお願いする形になります。
    </p>

    <h3>7. ドメイン接続 & 正式公開</h3>
    <p>
      入金が確認できたら、ご希望の独自ドメインとサイトを接続し、  
      正式なポートフォリオサイトとして公開します。
    </p>

    <p>
      公開後数日の間に、  
      デバイスの違いなどで小さなズレ（余白、画像の位置など）が見つかる場合がありますが、  
      そうした軽微な調整は <strong>無料で対応</strong> します。  
      静的サイトでは、ごく自然に起こりうる範囲のものです。
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="return-policy-ja">
    <h2>キャンセル・返金ポリシー</h2>

    <p>
      このサービスは、信頼している友人に向けた「成果ベース」のサポートプロジェクトです。<br>
      まずテストリンクで完成版を確認してもらい、そのうえでお支払いに進んでいただきます。
    </p>

    <h3>キャンセルについて</h3>
    <p>
      制作の途中で方向性が大きく変わったり、続行が難しくなった場合は、  
      どの段階でもキャンセルしていただいて構いません。  
      その際は、できるだけ早いタイミングで状況を共有してもらえると助かります。
    </p>

    <h3>承認後の返金について</h3>
    <p>
      テストリンクを確認し、「この内容で大丈夫」と承認いただいた時点で、  
      制作は完了とみなされます。<br>
      その後の返金は基本的に受け付けられませんが、  
      <strong>私のミスによる、致命的かつ修正不能なコード上のエラー</strong> がある場合のみ、  
      例外的に返金を検討します。
    </p>

    <p>
      公開から数日以内に見つかるような小さな不具合  
      （軽微なレイアウト調整や画像位置の微修正など）は、  
      静的サイトではよくある範囲のものですので、  
      これらは <strong>無料で修正</strong> します。
    </p>

    <h3>外部要因について</h3>
    <p>
      iOS やブラウザのアップデート、GitHub の仕様変更、  
      特定デバイス固有の挙動など、外部要因による変化が原因の問題については、  
      <strong>返金の対象外</strong> とさせていただきます。
    </p>

    <p>
      そのような外部要因によるトラブルが発生した場合も、  
      可能な範囲で状況を確認し、必要に応じて調整や修正の提案を行います。  
      ただし、作業のボリュームによっては、追加費用が発生する場合があります。

  <section id="faq-ja">
    <h2>FAQ</h2>
      <h3>Q. 他のデザイナーにコードを引き継ぐことはできますか？</h3>
    <p>
      A. はい、可能です。サイトはあなたのものなので、  
      どのデザイナーと一緒に更新をするかは、自由に選んでいただけます。
    </p>
     <h3>Q. 納品後に、他の人にコードを修正してもらってもいいですか？</h3>
    <p>
      はい、可能です。ただし第三者がコードを書き換えた場合、 私が用意した構造とは異なる状態になる可能性があります。<br> その場合、サポート期間中であっても、同じ条件での更新や修正の対応が難しくなる、または継続できなくなる可能性がございます。<br> ご不安な場合は、作業前に一度ご相談いただけると安心です。
    </p>
    <p class="note-warning">ここでいう「コードの維持・更新」とは、画像の追加・差し替えや、キャプションなどの軽いテキスト変更のことを指します。
    新しいページの追加や新機能の実装など、大幅な構造変更を含むものではありません。</p>
  
     <h3>Q. 少人数制とはどれくらいの人数ですか？</h3>
    <p>
      A. 現時点では10名ほどを想定していますが、状況に応じて無理のない範囲で増減する可能性があります。あらかじめご了承ください。
    </p>

    <div class="faq-hidden">

    <h3>Q. これはフルカスタムサイトですか？</h3>
    <p>
      A. 厳密には「セミカスタム」ですが、最終的な見た目やクオリティは  
      フルカスタムにかなり近い仕上がりになります。
    </p>

    <h3>Q. フルカスタムとセミカスタムの違いは何ですか？</h3>
    <p>
      A. 一般的なセミカスタムサイトは、Wix や WordPress のような既存のテンプレートや CMS をベースに、  
      色やフォント、簡単なレイアウトだけを調整するものが多いです。<br>
      私の方法ではテンプレートを一切使わず、レイアウト・画像構成・余白・見せ方を  
      最初から設計していくため、結果として「ほぼフルカスタム」に近いサイトになります。
    </p>

    <h3>Q. なぜ最初からフルカスタムにしないのですか？</h3>
    <p>
      A. アーティストのポートフォリオには、重いCMSや複雑なプラグインは基本的に不要で、  
      むしろそれらが原因で、サイトが重くなったり壊れやすくなったりすることがあります。<br>
      必要な部分だけを手作りすることで、軽くて安定した、長期運用向きのポートフォリオになります。
    </p>

    <h3>Q. なぜ「制作費」ではなく「制作サポート費」と書いてあるのですか？</h3>
    <p>
      A. このサービスは、あなたと私のあいだに「不要な依存関係」を作らないことを  
      大きなテーマにしています。<br>
      そのため、コードファイルや GitHub アカウントは、最初から  
      <strong>すべてあなたの所有物</strong> という前提で進めます。
    </p>
    <p>
      サイトのアートディレクションはあなた自身が担い、  
      私はそのビジョンを形にするための提案と技術サポートを提供する立場です。
    </p>
    <p>
      つまりこのサイトは、「私が作ってあげるもの」というより、  
      <strong>あなたと私の共同制作</strong> というイメージに近いと思っています。<br>
      そのため、名目として「制作サポート費」という表現を使っています。
    </p>

    <h3>Q. サイトの所有者は誰になりますか？</h3>
    <p>
      A. サイトの所有者は、あくまであなたです。  
      GitHub アカウントも、コード一式も、あなたの名義で管理されます。
    </p>

    <h3>Q. 2年ごとの更新は必須ですか？タイミングは？</h3>
    <p>
      A. 更新は完全にオプションです。  
      更新しなくてもサイトはそのままオンラインに残ります。<br>
      サポート期間の終了が近づいたら、1か月前を目安に私の方からお知らせします。
    </p>

    <h3>Q. 無料更新には何が含まれますか？</h3>
    <p>
      A. 週2回までの小さな更新（画像の追加・差し替え、クレジットやテキストの微調整など）が含まれます。
    </p>

    <h3>Q. 将来的に、Natsuki がこのサービスをやめてしまう可能性はありますか？</h3>
    <p>
      A. あります。  
      私の本業はメイクアップアーティストなので、将来的に忙しさによって  
      サポートを続けられなくなる可能性はゼロではありません。<br>
      その場合でも、少なくとも <strong>6か月前</strong> には事前にお伝えします。
    </p>

    <h3>Q. 納品直後にサービスをやめられてしまう心配は？</h3>
    <p>
      A. その点については心配はいりません。  
      納品後の「最初の2年間のサポート」はサービスの根幹と考えていて、  
      重大な事情（事故や重い病気など）がない限り、  
      この2年間を途中で放棄することはありません。<br>
      初期2年のサポートについては、安心していただいて大丈夫です。
    </p>

    <p>
      また、サイトそのものはあなたの GitHub アカウントに紐づいています。  
      そのため、たとえ将来的に私のサポートが終了したとしても、  
      サイトはそのまま使い続けることができますし、他のデザイナーに引き継ぐことも可能です。
    </p>

    <h3>Q. GitHub を使ったことがなくても大丈夫ですか？</h3>
    <p>
      A. まったく問題ありません。  
      アカウント作成から公開まで、必要なステップは一緒に進めていきます。<br>
      面倒な技術的作業はこちらで対応しますので、コードに触れる必要はありません。
    </p>

    <h3>Q. 新しい写真や更新内容はどうやって送ればいいですか？</h3>
    <p>
      A. DM やメールなど、いつも使っている連絡手段で大丈夫です。  
      画像・キャプション・クレジットなどを送ってもらえれば、  
      「週2回までの更新」の範囲で反映していきます。
    </p>

    <h3>Q. 画像点数に制限はありますか？</h3>
    <p>
      A. 技術的な意味での「枚数制限」はありません。  
      ただし、あまりにも画像が多すぎると、全体の方向性がぼやけてしまうこともあります。<br>
      どのくらいのボリュームが最適かは、一緒に相談しながら決めていきます。
    </p>

    <h3>Q. 納品後に、構成を大きく変えたくなったら？</h3>
    <p>
      A. 小さな変更であれば対応可能です。  
      新しいカテゴリーの追加や、大幅なレイアウト変更など「構造レベル」の変更については、  
      新たな制作として、内容に応じて相談させてください。
    </p>

    <h3>Q. 2つ目のセミカスタムサイトをお願いすることはできますか？</h3>
    <p>
      A. 私のスケジュール次第ですが、タイミングが合えば可能な場合もあります。  
      まずは一度ご相談ください。
    </p>

    <h3>Q. 写真の使用権についてはどうなりますか？</h3>
    <p>
      A. 基本的に、クライアント（＝あなた）が正当な使用権を持っている前提で進めます。  
      著作権・使用権の責任は、デザイナーではなく、  
      画像を提供するクライアント側にあるものとお考えください。
    </p>

    <h3>Q. SEO 対策はどうなっていますか？</h3>
    <p>
      A. アーティストのポートフォリオに対して、  
      いわゆる「攻めの SEO（検索上位表示を狙う施策）」は必須ではないと考えています。<br>
      とはいえ、基本的なメタ情報や構造は適切に設定しますので、  
      「必要最低限の SEO」はきちんと押さえた状態になります。<br>
      このサイトの目的は、大勢に向けて広く見つけてもらうことではなく、  
      <strong>あなたが本当に見せたい相手に、きちんと作品を届けること</strong> です。
    </p>

    <h3>Q. 将来的に、サービス内容や料金が変わる可能性はありますか？</h3> 
    <p>
      A. はい、あります。  
      サポートの質を維持・向上させるために、サービス内容やポリシー、料金体系を  
      見直す必要が出てくることもあると思います。<br>
      その場合、すでにサービスを利用している方には事前に内容を説明し、  
      ご理解・ご承認をいただいたうえで適用する形をとります。

    <h2>最後に</h2>

    <p>
      ここまで読んでくださって、本当にありがとうございます。<br>
      このプロジェクトは、もともと「自分のポートフォリオを整えたい」という  
      とても個人的なニーズからスタートしました。<br>
      ですが進めていくうちに、私の周りの多くのアーティストが  
      実は同じような悩みを抱えていることに気づきました。
    </p>

    <p>
      私が目指したのは、大きなビジネスではなく、  
      小さくてパーソナルで、意味のある仕組みです。<br>
      信頼している友人たちをサポートし、  
      それぞれが自分のクリエイティブキャリアを、  
      もう少しクリアな気持ちで、安心して前に進めるようなお手伝いができたら、  
      という思いから生まれたプロジェクトです。
    </p>

    <p>
      その意図から生まれたのが、「<strong>Artists on Website</strong>」です。
    </p>

    <p>
      これはクライアントリストを増やすためのビジネスではありません。<br>
      私の友人であるアーティストたちと共有したい、  
      シンプルで透明性のあるパートナーシップです。
    </p>

    <p>
      もしこのプロジェクトが、あなたの創作活動やキャリアにとって  
      少しでも前に進むきっかけになれたなら、  
      それ以上に嬉しいことはありません。
